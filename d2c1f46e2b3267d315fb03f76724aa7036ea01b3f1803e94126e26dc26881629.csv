This was done with a Spanish interpreter.  I spent a total of 70 minutes from 9:15 A.M. to 10:25 A.M. face-to-face care with this patient on 11/09/2021 with a Spanish interpreter discussing with the patient his options for therapy.      Briefly, he is, as you are aware, a 33 year old with multiple myeloma, IgG kappa.  If I understand correctly, he was originally diagnosed around 03/2019 with an M-spike of around 6   . He had generalized weakness, back and chest wall discomfort for about 10 days prior to the diagnosis.  At diagnosis, he had  a calcium of 9.7, an IgG of 5610, kappa lambda ratio of 190, total protein 10.7, albumin of 2.3.  UPEP was positive by  immunofixation.  Vitamin D of 10, kappa was 64.9, lambda 0.34, and his bone marrow showed myeloma.  The patient had a CT that had lytic lesions including the left fifth rib and the sacrum.  If I understand correctly, he was felt to have Strep pneumoniae sepsis with his first cycle of Cytoxan, Velcade Dex.  There was no FISH and no beta 2 as far as I could find in the records sent to me.  If I understand correctly, he was treated with Cytoxan, Velcade, dexamethasone and then for 6 cycles and then put on maintenance Revlimid.  In 11/2019 his M-spike was 0.6 with beta 2 microglobulin of 1.5.  He was then being evaluated for an autotransplant.  His M-spike went down to 0.3.  If I understand correctly, he was being assessed at Oceans Behavioral Hospital Of Lake Charles.  They said he had no insurance  coverage because of his immigration status and so he was not offered a transplant nor he was referred for charity care over to the Cleburne Surgical Center LLP.  If I understand, he was continued on maintenance Revlimid until about 04/2020 when he got switched to RVD as MM disease started to declare itself again.  If I understand, in 11/2020 he got COVID  but before that on 06/01/2020 he was switched to dara, RVD  because of disease declaring itself.  He then was off of therapy because of COVID.  In 10/2020   kappa was 24.67, kappa lambda 137.06.  In 12/2020   kappa was 30.75, kappa lambda 16184.  Of note, he reported that when he got COVID diagnosed in 11/2020 he had just gotten his flu shot and he just felt sick with a lot of congestion.  Of note, he has never received COVID-19 vaccines.  If I understand correctly, he was progressing again and in 04/2021 to 07/2021 he went on again Cytoxan, Velcade, dexamethasone.  CTs had   Axillary  and retroperitoneal  adenopathy left frontal, parietal skull mass that was increasing.  In August 2021  he was switched to carfilzomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, where his PET prestarting  showed a number of new sites of disease.  For example, he had in August a 4.8 cm enhancing mass in the left frontoparietal intra external with skull mass effect.  He has not  Had any  LP  which I would recommend prior to transplant here at our center.  He had an MRI of his bone marrow on 08/21 that had a 3.1 x 3.6 cm skull lesion.  CT appeared to be completely replaced.  There was **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** a T1 lesion, left femoral neck, bilateral sacra, ala, distal right femur, increased proximal humeri.  He had a 6.5 x 5.1 cm lesion with 1 to 3 rib involvement into the left axilla with a left axillary mass of 4.5 x 2.4 cm.    He got radiation therapy to left skull 3000 cGy from 08/31/2021 to 09/08/2021; right shoulder 800 Gy on 09/01; left shoulder 800 Gy 09/02; upper pelvis, bilateral hips 800 Gy 09/03.  He said his pain in his chest and back got a lot better after radiation.  He believes he started some unknown bone strengthening drug in 2019 and has continued to receive.  On 09/01/21  Serum  kappa was down to 4.48 with a lambda 0.7, kappa lambda of 6.31.  Of note, on 06/21 his kappa had been 20.78 per dL, lambda 0.24 and a kappa lambda of  86.58.    ALLERGIES:  Include PIPERACILLIN and ZOSYN - rash.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral hearing loss with bilateral perforated tympanic membranes.  Never a smoker.  Did not use marijuana products.  No alcohol abuse.  No fracture history prior to  myeloma diagnosis or loss of consciousness or seizures.  He denies peripheral neuropathy issues or bone pain at this time.  The patient is an illegal Psychologist, counselling that has been 18 years in the Montenegro.  He will need charity care and I have put in a note to intake as well as the social worker  To ask to deal with this issue .  He will need help with covering hospitalization costs at Outpatient Womens And Childrens Surgery Center Ltd as well as SCCA as well as housing costs when he is not hospitalized.  He does not  know he had chickenpox, but he might have.  He denies TB exposure but got BCG vaccination.     Social In terms of his last job, it was carpentering with building wood pellets.  He has not worked though since he was first diagnosed in 2019.His brother-in-law and sister will be his caregivers and they both have been COVID-19 vaccinated per their information.   He is from Trinidad and Tobago.    His current medications include   acyclovir 400 mg p.o. two times a day.  He says when he takes dexamethasone it is 40 mg po  a week, pomalidomide he currently takes 4 mg po days 1-21 with 28-day cycles, potassium chloride 20 mEq po a day, aspirin 81 mg po a day.  He thinks he is taking calcium and vitamin D, but he was not sure.  If he is not since he is reportedly still getting bone strengthening drugs he should be on it.      FAMILY HISTORY:  Seven brothers and sisters.   Parents are alive.  Mother has diabetes.  There is some unknown cancer in a grandmother      In summary, Mr. Mandrell Vangilder is a 51 year old gentleman with relapsed MM , now  responding disease.  We do not know what stage he was when he first presented but definitely had a number of lytic lesions anyway so it would be DS 3.  The patient has not had  cytogenetics as far as I can tell in any of the material that was sent to Korea on his marrow so I cannot tell his risk, but given the situation that he is in we would be looking at only getting one autologous  transplant anyway as  that would be considered standard of care. **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** We did discuss with the patient one of his options is that he could continue with just standard therapy like he has been doing although he is running out of many standard drugs. But,   since he has now got a good response to carfilzomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone it would not be unreasonable now to consider collecting autologous PBSC stem cells and doing an autologous  transplant as we do have therapy we know he is responding to that we could use as post-transplant   treatment.  We discussed whether it is going to be maintenance or consolidation will be dependent on whether when he comes here whether we could get any material to do FISH on to see if he is high risk or standard risk.      We did discuss with the patient that he would not be a candidate for an allogeneic TX  as it is not considered standard of care and it has an increased morbidity and mortality because of GVHD, where the cells from the donor recognize the patient's body as foreign and can attack the skin, the mouth, the lungs, the liver, the lining of GI tract, the muscles, joints, the eyes.  People with GVHD are more vulnerable to infection.  Discuss if get chronic GVHd and need therapy not quick fix  but can need 3-3.75 years of therapy on average and many patients never establish tolerance  and need long term therapy 5 or more years down th road  for chronic GVHD.  Anyway, the patient also would not be interested in allogeneic  approach given increased morbidity and morality..      We then spent time focusing on auto transplants  We discussed that in somebody in good shape before COVID, the mortality rate in the first 100 days was less than 0.5% with deaths from  infection, bleeding, multiorgan failure.  We discussed with him some of the toxicities of the autotransplant which include myelosuppression, susceptibility to infection and bleeding, requirement for blood and platelet transfusions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores, skin rashes , esophagitis, fatigue, alopecia.  We did discuss about sterility.  He said sterility was not an issue for him.  He has his children, he does not need any more.  , rare VOD/SOS, rare pulmonary toxicities that can be delayed , rare  cardiac, liver, bladder, neurological long-term, increased risk for dental issues, cataracts, hypothyroidism, low testosterone, metabolic syndrome,   rare secondary cancers including skin cancer, myelodysplasia/leukemia and other hematological and nonhematological malignancies, fatigue, need to be revaccinated, metabolic syndrome and osteopenia/osteporosis.  We did discuss with the patient that he would need to get the COVID-19 vaccines, at least 3 post-transplant starting at day 90.  Most likely will be recommending 2 re-boosts to a total of 4 in the future.  We discussed that we are thinking that they will not take as well to vaccinate people early after an autotransplant and maybe only roughly half will get some response so will be more vulnerable to getting COVID than the general population after a transplant.  He needs to continue with handwashing, social distancing and masking.      We did discuss with the patient the autotransplant is not curative.  What is done is to buy time before he needs to go to other therapies.  Since he has already had numerous relapses it is hard to believe that he would not relapse again after high-dose melphalan and so really what this is being used for is to buy **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** time.  We discussed there will be other therapies down the road like drug conjugated antibodies that are FDA approved, bites or clinical trials that may be approved in the future as well as CARs which are FDA  approved that he could potentially be considered for although at this time, as you are well aware, there is not charity care right now for commercially available CARs as it is not yet considered standard of care and because of its restrictive costs.  That all said, there will be potentially other clinical trials in the future where he may be able to participate in when  MM  disease comes back but we did discuss the longer he goes without needing those therapies than the longer he lives  There will be  more options in the future for treating  him than we have today.      We discussed when the patient first comes to our center he would get   an evaluation to see for what kind of shape he is in as well as  Assess status of  yeloma, with bone marrow, blood, 24-hour urine, scans of bone.  If he has good MM disease control it would be growth factor alone to collect his cells.  If he has too much disease, it would be  chemomobilization therapy   with growth factor and collecting his cells when he recovers from that chemotherapy.  We then after collect auto PBSC  go to the high-dose melphalan auto transplant and that if he has caregivers it will minimize his hospitalization time.  We did discuss with the patient that 30% of people with full time caregivers may not need to be hospitalized and can do   all in the outpatient department.        We discussed that he should plan to be about 2-1/2 to 3 months our patient in South Carolina, living within 30-45 minutes of our center, that at this time there are no classes because of the fact of COVID.  There will be 1:1 Zoom teaching to teach him about immunocompromised diet etc. when he gets here.  We discussed the rotation schedule of attendings and primary care providers. Discuss  when admit to the hospital,  It is Sissonville/SCCA and physicians caring for him in  the hospital are Cerritos Surgery Center based but different individuals than cared for him in the outpatient department.  We discussed at this time,  I think that his myeloma is more risky than COVID given that he has gone through already a number of therapies and has had MM disease for a while.  We did discuss with the patient, though he does have to be aware that there is  risk because of COVID still being present in a pandemic  .   We discuss requiring in future caregivers to be covid 19 vaccinated.     We did discuss with the patient that we would recommend he continue therapy until he can get dates to come into our system if he wants to undergo collection  and auto  Mark at our center. We discussed that he should touch base with you and if he wants to pursue this then you can call our intake office to get dates for him at 254-510-1732.  I did note that we do have a waiting list because of COVID. Discuss charity care will need to be arranged before can come into our center to cover costs of therapy. **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** If there are any questions, please feel free to call me at 930 446 7122.  The patient appeared to be interested in going ahead with collection and autolgous TX.  So, We did ask her social worker to call the patient about trying to see how we can help him to get charity care at the Wyano as well as housing coverage to help him to be able to be treated here.  If there are other questions, you can also call the intake office at 9297514551.      As always, it is a pleasure to see one your patients.  Thank you for working with our center.        cc: Norris Cross MD                 Southern Maine Medical Center                  Iago, WA 09311"

At the time of the call, the patient was driving so I spoke to his wife. I explained that for auto transplant, patient would be in South Carolina for 2+ months, including pre-transplant work-up, cell collection, conditioning, transplant, and 30 days post-transplant.    I explained that because patient has emergency-only Medicaid, we will reach out to our housing coordinator Sheilah Mins re: determining whether Medicaid or financial assistance will cover lodging.     I told him about SCCA House and L-3 Communications and that there may be a CG requirement for 30 days post-transplant, but that patients sometimes will be allowed to go through autologous transplant without a caregiver.    I explained that upon arrival, Patient and caregiver will have an initial consult with Social Work during which they will have the opportunity to further discuss housing and financial assistance applications. I also explained that MSW will reach out to the housing coordinator after their treatment dates are confirmed by the medical team because Patient wasn't sure who should reach out to Suncoast Behavioral Health Center.     Patient's wife asked whether housing assistance would be able to provide lodging for their 3 young children. I advised that they should discuss this with Melissa.     Patient's wife communicated that they were unsure about treatment dates and upcoming appointments. I mentioned that the medical team will be communicating dates with them.    Patient is aware of The Hand Center LLC, Southern Coos Hospital & Health Center and financial assistance options that they may be eligible for; and that this information will be reviewed during his SW consult."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS   Mr. Jas Betten a 9 year old with IgG kappa multiple myeloma, who was originally diagnosed around 03/2019 after experiencing generalized weakness, back, and chest wall discomfort for 10 days. At that time, he had an M-spike of 6, calcium of 9.7, an IgG of 5610, kappa FLC 64.9, lambda FLC 0.34, kappa/lambda ratio of 190, total protein 10.7, albumin of 2.3, vitamin D of 10. UPEP was positive by immunofixation, and his bone marrow showed myeloma. The patient had a CT that had lytic lesions including the left fifth rib and the sacrum. At that time, he was started on CyBorD (Cytoxan, Velcade, and Dexamethasone), and completed 6 cycles of this, from 3/2019 - 11/2019.     In 11/2019 his M-spike was 0.6 with beta 2 microglobulin of 1.5. His M-spike went down to 0.3. MRI at this time showed pathological fractures of T3, T6, and T8, with multiple lesions in the skull, axial, and appendicular skeleton. The lesions in his bilateral proximal humeri were at risk for pathological fracture. He was being evaluated for an autotransplant at Neurological Institute Ambulatory Surgical Center LLC, but his insurance would not cover the transplant. He was then placed on maintenance Revlimid from 12/2019-4/2020, when he got switched to RVd (Revlimid, Velcade, and Dexamethasone) as his M-spike increased again, then to RVd with daratumumab in 6/2020.     In 11/2020, Mr. Tapia Diarte tested positive for COVID. He was experiencing congestion, but attributed it to getting his flu vaccine that week. His wife and youngest child also tested positive at that time, but were asymptomatic. He has never been vaccinated against COVID. Treatment was  stopped for a week or 2 at that time, then restarted. In 10/2020, kappa FLC was 24.67, kappa/lambda ratio was 137.06. In 12/2020, kappa FLC was 30.75, kappa/lambda ratio 161.84. From 4/2021 to 7/2021, he went back on CyBorD. In 6/2021, he had kappa FLC of 20.78, lambda FLC of 0.24, kappa/lambda ratio of 86.58. CT showed axillary and retroperitoneal adenopathy, as well as an increasing left skull mass.      PET/CT in 8/2021 showed multiple new sites of disease, with 4.8cm enhancing frontoparietal skull mass. MRI of his bone marrow at that time showed a 3.1 x 3.6 cm skull lesion with extraosseous extension into the scalp and intracranial cavity with mass effect on the brain. It also showed significant progressive metastatic disease in the axial and appendicular skeleton, with innumerable new and enlarging lesions. Lesions in the proximal left and right humerus, distal right femur, and proximal left femur are at risk of pathological fracture. The vertebral body of C2 had been nearly completely replaced, and there was a large soft tissue mass in the anterolateral left chest wall. At that time, he was switched to KPD (carfilzomib, pomalyst, and dexamethasone), which he has been receiving since. His last doses of Carfilzomib were 12/8-9. His last dose of decadron was 12/10. His last dose of Pomalyst was 12/14.    He got radiation therapy to left skull 3000 cGy from 08/31/2021 to 09/08/2021; right shoulder 800 Gy on 09/01; left shoulder 800 Gy 09/02; upper pelvis, bilateral hips 800 Gy 09/03. He said his pain in his chest and **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** back got a lot better after radiation. He believes he started some unknown bone strengthening drug in 2019 and has continued to receive, but it is not on his medication list. On 09/01/21 M-spike was 3.1, with Serum kappa down to 4.48 with a lambda 0.7, kappa/lambda ratio of 6.31. His most recent labs on 12/1/21 show an M-spike of 0.2, kappa FLC 1.45, lambda FLC 0.73, and kappa/lambda ratio of 1.99. He  has not had a diagnostic LP thus far.        Mr. Almond Fitzgibbon is seen today with his wife, Dewitt Hoes, to discuss stem cell mobilization and autologous SCT. They are Spanish-speaking only, and an interpreter was utilized for this appointment. He had no fracture history prior to myeloma diagnosis or loss of consciousness or seizures.

Also present in the conference was the team nurse and the patients wife. The patient and his wife are spanish speakers primarily and an interpreter was present for the entire meeting. The patient is here for stem cell collection and autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma. For additional detailed history regarding the patients multiple myeloma and past medical history, please refer to history and physical exam note dictated by Dr. Oley Balm MD,PhD on 11/9.         ONCOLOGIC HISTORY    The patient a 30 year old male with IgG kappa multiple myeloma, originally diagnosed in March 2019. He was weak and ill with skeletal pain was was admitted to an outside hospital from 3/23/2019 through 4/1/2019. At diagnosis M-spike was 6, Hgb 8.4, calcium of 9.7, albumin 2.3, adjusted calcium level 11.1, creatinine 0.99. IgG of 5610, kappa FLC 64.9, lappa/lambda ratio of 190, total protein 10.7. Biopsy of left 3rd rib p demonstrated plasmacytoma. Bone marrow biopsy was not performed. 3/30 CT angiogram to r/o PE:  FINDINGS: No PE.  Left lateral third rib soft tissue mass with bone destruction, the mass measures 5.4 x 3.9 cm. Left lateral fifth lytic bone metastasis with soft tissue component present. Lytic bone metastasis seen at the left lateral eighth rib, unchanged. Multiple lytic bone metastasis again seen in the spine.  Started on CyBorD and completed 6 cycles between 3/2019 - 11/2019. Repeat bone marrow biopsy 10/18/2019 with 5% residual myeloma plasma cells.   MRI showed pathological fractures of T3, T6, and T8, with multiple lesions in the skull, axial, and appendicular skeleton. Lesions in bilateral proximal humeri were at risk for pathological fracture. Evaluated for autotransplant at Presentation Medical Center, but his insurance would not cover the transplant. He was then placed on maintenance  Revlimid from 12/2019-4/2020. In 11/2020, the patient tested positive for COVID (never vaccinated) but did not suffer serious illness.  There were problems with getting the Revlimid reliably and his M-spike began to climb. Plan was to add daratumumab to the lenalidomide. However there were insurance difficulties getting this therapy going and so he was placed back on CyBorD.  He had some control of disease temporarily.      PET/CT in 8/2021 showed multiple new sites of disease, with 4.8cm enhancing frontoparietal skull mass. MRI of his bone marrow at that time showed a 3.1 x 3.6 cm skull lesion with extraosseous extension into the scalp and intracranial cavity with mass effect on the brain. It also showed significant progressive metastatic disease in the axial and appendicular skeleton, with innumerable new and enlarging lesions. Lesions in the proximal left and right humerus, distal right femur, and proximal left femur are at risk of pathological fracture. The vertebral body of C2 had been nearly completely replaced, and there was a large soft tissue mass in the anterolateral left chest wall. At that time, he was switched to KPD (carfilzomib, pomalyst, and dexamethasone), which he has been receiving since. His last doses of Carfilzomib were 12/8-9. His last dose of decadron was 12/10. His last dose of Pomalyst was 12/14.     He got radiation therapy to left skull 3000 cGy from 08/31/2021 to 09/08/2021; right shoulder 800 Gy on 09/01; left shoulder 800 Gy 09/02; upper pelvis, bilateral hips 800 Gy 09/03. He said his pain in his chest and back got a lot better after radiation. He believes **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** he started some unknown bone strengthening drug in 2019 and has continued to receive, but it is not on his medication list. On 09/01/21 M-spike was 3.1. On 12/1/21 show an M-spike of 0.2.          PROBLEM LIST  1. IgG kappa multiple myeloma  2. Chronic bilateral TM perforation and recurrent infections  3. Bilateral hearing loss  4.   Kidney stone 2005  5. Obesity  6. Social and financial challenges    Past surgical history:  None     Allergies:  Zosyn - rash     MEDICATIONS     See medication list     Social history   Home: Originally from Czech Republic, Trinidad and Tobago. He is an undocumented immigrant, who has been in the Montenegro for 23 years. Lives in Felton, New Mexico. Caregiver: wife Dewitt Hoes will be the primary caregiver. His brother, Cassandria Santee, can also help.     Review of the potential benefits, risks and process of stem cell transplantation    After reviewing with the patient his personal history of multiple myeloma we discussed the rationale of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(ASCT) as part of the treatment of multiple myeloma.  We discussed that autologous transplant allows administration of higher doses of chemotherapy for better control of myeloma; I noted that autologous transplant was shown to prolong survival by 1-1.5 years in older studies and improved progression free survival as well. The most recent trial the IFM209 Attal,N Engl J Med 2017;376:1311-20 reported that median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group that underwent transplantation than in the group that received RVD alone (50 months vs. 36 months). No difference in overall survival was seen but the study was not mature enough potentially to see a survival difference.  In addition in 2017, Ivey 62:7035-0093 published a meta-analysis of three large randomized myeloma transplant trials that utilized lenalidomide maintenance that demonstrated a median PFS was 52.8 months for the lenalidomide group and 23.5 months for the placebo or observation group (hazard ratio, 0.48;95% CI, 0.41 to 0.55). At a median follow-up time of 79.5 months for all surviving patients, the median OS had not been reached for the lenalidomide maintenance group, whereas it was 86.0 months for the placebo or observation group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI,  0.63 to 0.90; P = .001).  I explained that ASCT will not cure the patient from the myeloma due to the risk of relapse post-transplant.  We discussed that in order to improve transplant outcome, we strongly recommend maintenance therapy after transplant. In a standard risk patient such as this Revlimid would be the recommended maintenance therapy at '10mg'$  D1-21.  I discussed with the patient that he will complete a pretransplant evaluation, which includes blood tests and urine tests as well as imaging with x-rays and MRI or CT/PET for evaluation of the current disease status. Due to the extensive involvement of his skull an LP will be performed. We discussed with the patient that in addition to disease status evaluation the patient will also undergo evaluation of function of main organs including blood tests to evaluate kidney function and liver function, EKG, and echocardiogram to evaluate heart function and x-ray and pulmonary function tests to evaluate lung function.  The patient will also be seen by Oral Medicine team at the Buchanan General Hospital prior to transplant to evaluate dental status before proceeding with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. I discussed with the patient that prior to autologous transplant, in addition **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** to extensive testing of his organ function it will be necessary to collect his autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells.    I discussed with the patient that depending on the burden of myeloma determined in his pretransplant evaluation we may or may not add chemotherapy (usually cyclophosphamide) to the collection regimen. If there is no evidence of high burden of disease stem cells will be mobilized and collected using growth factors alone.  We discussed that stem cells will be collected by apheresis.    Stem cell collection  We then reviewed the process for autologous peripheral blood stem cell collection, mobilization, and pheresis. I also reviewed the procedure for placement of the  Hickman large-bore apheresis catheter. I reviewed the potential risks associated with indwelling central venous catheters including clotting and infection. I explained the potential side effects of daily G-CSF including bone pain, muscle ache, joint pain, splenomegaly, headache, transient abnormal liver function tests and thrombocytopenia.  I reviewed the typical blood cell count changes due to G-CSF and the typical time course for achieving elevated levels of circulating CD34+ cells. I described the several day window of opportunity for collection of the autologous PBSC CD34 cells that are mobilized into the peripheral blood. There is also the possibility of using plerixafor in the event the G-CSF is not able to mobilize a sufficient number of peripheral blood stem cells.     The most common apheresis-specific reaction is hypocalcemia due to citrate anticoagulation, which, while usually mild, has the potential for severely injuring the patient. Other reactions to apheresis donation are uncommon (e.g., hypotension) or rare (e.g., air embolism). This produces the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity including perioral paresthesias, shivering, light-headedness, twitching, and tremors. In addition, some patients also experience nausea and vomiting. If calcium levels fall severely symptoms may progress to carpopedal spasm, tetany, and seizure. Calcium supplementation is often given to donors when they complain of paraesthesia/tingling or numbness sensations. Hypotension can be seen with citrate reactions and may be due to the depressed myocardial function as well as to vascular smooth muscle relaxation.    We reviewed the apheresis procedure for collection of the PBSC.  I described the apheresis device and the centrifugation of the blood cell components within the sterile plastic tubing and the isolation of PBSC. I reviewed the risk of the procedure including the risk of infection or bleeding or clotting. I reviewed  the potential need for red blood cell and platelet transfusion support either before or after the apheresis procedure. I described the use of acid citrate dextrose and heparin as anticoagulants used in the sterile tubing apheresis device during the procedure.  I reviewed the risk and treatment of hypocalcemia and possible bleeding associated with the anticoagulant that is used in the apheresis tubing.  I reviewed the method of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection and the target collection goal of 10 x 10(6) CD34 positive cells/kg and the storage of the PBSC.  The unmanipulated PBSC are cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DSMO) solution and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use for the autologous PBSC transplant. I explained the possible need for multiple consecutive days of apheresis for collecting the target number of CD34+ cells in the PBSC product and the potential use of increased doses of G-CSF and/or plerixafor to increase the yield of CD34+ cells for collection and storage.   Following collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells, the patient would then have an approximately 1 week washout period in order to recover peripheral blood cell **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** counts to normal levels prior to the administration of high dose melphalan if he proceeds directly to ASCT.    Stem cell transplant   I discussed with the patient that after collection of autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells we will proceed with autologous transplantation after administration of high-dose melphalan that is given in order to kill as many as possible of residual malignant cells or residual abnormal plasma cells in his body and he will then be rescued with his own hematopoietic progenitor cells that will be collected prior to administration of high-dose melphalan.    The discussion of transplant started a review of the administration of high dose melphalan on               Day -2. We infuse the autologous peripheral blood stem  cells into the patient approximately 48 hours after completion of the high dose melphalan chemotherapy. I reviewed the potential toxicity from DMSO and the infusion of autologous peripheral blood stem cells.  DMSO may cause hypotension.  It may cause a flushing reaction and may cause shortness of breath and cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients have had potential fatal cardiac arrhythmias from DMSO infusion.  DMSO may cause hemolysis and kidney injury which is typically reversible.  DMSO may also cause allergic reaction including skin rash, a Stevens-Johnson type syndrome, or hematuria for typically a brief duration of time.  DMSO may cause hypotension or, alternatively, hypertension.  I reviewed that the DMSO has a foul odor and the patients breathe off the DMSO over the day or two after the stem cell infusion.      I discussed with the patient side effects and potential toxicities of high-dose melphalan, including myelosuppression, susceptibility to infection (including bacterial, fungal and viral infection), risk of bleeding with potential need for red blood cells and platelet transfusions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mouth sores, skin rashes, alopecia, sterility, pseudo GVHD, and, less commonly, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, liver and neurological toxicities.  I discussed with the patient a mortality risk from transplant of approximately 0.5 - 2% due to severe infection, bleeding, or organ failure.     Potential long term toxicities  As the interview took more than two hours due to the slow progress due to Spanish interpretation we did not discuss this topic.     Process of care at Winifred Masterson Burke Rehabilitation Hospital  I discussed with the patient that we attempt to perform stem cell mobilization, collection and stem cell transplantation in the outpatient setting; however, during the time of stem cell collection and transplantation he might need to be admitted to the Ocshner St. Anne General Hospital of Regional Rehabilitation Hospital. His likelihood for admission  of at least 7-14 days is 50-65%.  If the patient is admitted he will be cared for by the Transplant Team at the Aurora West Allis Medical Center Transplant Unit. I informed the patient that a team approach to care was taken at the Transplant Service at the St David'S Georgetown Hospital and Skypark Surgery Center LLC.  I explained to the patient that he was assigned to a specific team in the Transplant outpatient clinic where the team nurse remains the same during his course; however, the primary providers and attending physician will rotate on a monthly basis.    I discussed with the patient that he is expected to take residency in South Carolina within 30-minute drive from the Arkansas Children'S Northwest Inc. and the need for a designated caregiver for the time of stem cell collection and transplantation. His wife will be his caregiver.    I discussed with the patient that usually patients remain under the **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** care of the Transplant Team for approximately 4 weeks after transplant and at that time if there are no complications the patients are referred back to their primary oncologist.    The patients wife had several questions regarding the process of stem cell collection and transplantation, which all were answered to her satisfaction.  We then moved on to review and discuss a number of consents related to the transplant process which the patient signed.      TIME STATEMENT     I spent a total of 120 minutes with Napoleon and greater than 50% of the time was spent in face to face discussion on the management of his cancer and coordination of care."

Treated with CyBorD (3/2019-11/2019).  - In 11/2019 his M-spike was 0.6 with beta 2 microglobulin of 1.5. His M-spike went down to 0.3. MRI at this time showed pathological fractures of T3, T6, and T8, with multiple lesions in the skull, axial, and appendicular skeleton. The lesions in his bilateral proximal humeri were at risk for pathological fracture. Treated with Revlimid (12/2019-4/2020), then RVd (4/20-5/20), then **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** dara-RVd (6/2020-4/2021).   - From 4/2021 to 7/2021, he went back on CyBorD. In 6/2021, he had kappa FLC of 20.78, lambda FLC of 0.24, kappa/lambda ratio of 86.58. CT showed  axillary and retroperitonealadenopathy, as well as an increasing left skullmass.  - PET/CT in 8/2021 showed multiple new sites of disease, with 4.8cm enhancing frontoparietal skull mass. MRI of his bone marrow showed a 3.1 x 3.6 cm skull lesion with extension into the scalp and intracranial cavity with mass effect on the brain, significant progressive metastatic disease, with innumerable new and enlarging lesions. Lesions in the proximal left and right humerus, distal right femur, and proximal left femur are at risk of pathological fracture. The vertebral body of C2 had been nearly completely replaced, and there was a large soft tissue mass in the anterolateral left chest wall. At that time, he was switched to KPD (carfilzomib, pomalyst, and dexamethasone), which he has been receiving since. His last doses of Carfilzomib were 12/8-9. His last dose of decadron was 12/10. His last dose of Pomalyst was 12/14.  - Radiation therapy 3000 cGy to skull (8/2021-9/2021), and radiation therapy 800 cGy to bilat shoulders, pelvis, bilat hips (9/2021).   - Labs 12/15 show M-spike 0.1, KFLC 1.24, K/L ratio 1.72. Bone marrow 12/17 is negative by flow. Brain MRI on 12/18/21 shows improvement; left parietal bone lesion is now 2cm, with no mass effect on the brain.

DENTITION: The patient is partially edentulous.  He is missing teeth #1 ,3, 9 ,10, 14, 15, 19, 25 and 26.  He has mobility in several teeth.  Class II + mobility is detected on tooth #20.  Class I mobility detected in teeth #4 , 5 ,8, 11, 12, 17, 21, 24, and 30.    Slight mobility detected in teeth #27 , 28 , and 29 .root caries is detected in tooth #2 distal cervical.  The patient has no percussion sensitivity.  Decalcification observed in the facial surface of tooth #8.  Gingival recession is observed in several teeth.      SALIVA: No abnormal findings   There was quality coating of the tissue at rest and visible pooling of saliva in the floor of the mouth. Clear saliva was expressed of from all 4 major glands.    RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION AND  RADIOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT:   Panoramic and intraoral radiographs are available for review.  They were taken at the oral medicine services on December 21, 2021.    The radiographs were of good quality and suitable for diagnostic purposes.  The patient is partially edentulous.  He has generalized moderate bone loss, with severe bone loss observed in  teeth #20.  Severe vertical bone loss is observed #32 mesial and #20 mesial.    There was no periapical pathology. No widening of the periodontal ligament spaces, periapical radiolucency, or other signs of pathology.  Possible dental decay suspected in tooth #2 distal #13 distal.  Radiographic calculus was observed    The maxillary bone had a normal trabecular pattern, they appear small. the maxillary sinuses were well corticated and normal in shape without evidence of hard or soft tissue abnormality.    The mandibular condyles were normal in shape without loss of cortication or other signs of degenerative joint disease.  The coronoid processes and coronoid notches were normal in shape.  There was no thinning of the mandibular cortex. The inferior alveolar canals were well visualized along the length from the mandibular foramen to the mental foramen bilaterally.  The trabecular pattern in the mandible was also normal.      ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Today Mr. Yariel Ferraris was evaluated in the Oral Medicine service as part of his standard pretransplant examinations.    The primary purpose of today's appointment was to evaluate the oral cavity for any abnormalities which may put the patient at increased risk for complication in the **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** posttransplant period and to make a plan for management as indicated.    The patient has generalized moderate to severe bone loss with moderate to heavy calculus and plaque.  Dental cleaning is required prior to the transplant.  Tooth #20 has severe bone loss with class II plus mobility.  Extraction is recommended, however the patient has a  12 doses of Zometa total, with the last dose administered in the June 9, 2021.  The patient is at high risk of medication induced osteonecrosis of the jaw because of his Zometa history.  We will attempt to do dental cleaning first, and observe if the tooth can be stabilized with local measures.      DENTAL CLEARANCE: The following procedures must be completed before the patient can be dentally cleared for transplant: Dental cleaning     The patient will need to have antibiotic prophylaxis prior to his dental cleaning.    PRESCRIPTIONS:   Chlorhexidine mouth rinse      RETURN TO CLINIC:   1.  Dental cleaning  2.  Arestin placement in teeth #2 distal, 17 distal, 18 distal, 30 distal, 31 distal, and 32 distal.  3.  Fluoride varnish application  4.  Follow-up on oral hygiene practices(chlorhexidine mouth rinse use)   5.  SDF application #2 disto-cervical  6. Complete review of oral complications and oral complications management which will include review of oral mucositis, mucositis management, hyposalivation, hyposalivation management, taste dysfunction and lip care.      TIME STATEMENT: 30 minutes spent in direct patient care greater than 50% was spent counseling. Counseling included review of current oral status, recommendations for pretransplant stabilization including indications/risks/benefits/alternative therapies where available, oral hygiene recommendations, general preventive care strategies, prognosis, and next steps in care.

M-spike of 6,calcium of 9.7, an IgG of 5610,kappa FLC 64.9, kappa/lambda ratio of 190, total protein 10.7, UPEP was positiveby immunofixation,and bone marrow showed myeloma.CT showed lytic lesions in the left fifth rib and sacrum.   Treated with CyBorD (3/2019-11/2019).  - In 11/2019 his M-spike was 0.6 with beta 2 microglobulin of 1.5. His M-spike went down to 0.3.MRI at this time showed pathological fractures of T3, T6, and T8, with multiple lesions in the skull, axial, and appendicular skeleton. The lesions in his bilateral proximal humeri were at risk for pathological fracture. Treated with Revlimid (12/2019-4/2020), then RVd (4/20-5/20), then dara-RVd (6/2020-4/2021).   - From 4/2021 to 7/2021, he went back on CyBorD. In 6/2021, he had kappa FLC of 20.78, lambda FLC of 0.24, kappa/lambda ratio of 86.58. CT showed axillary and retroperitonealadenopathy, as well as an increasingleft skullmass.  - PET/CT in **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** 8/2021 showed multiple new sites of disease, with 4.8cm enhancing frontoparietal skull mass. MRIof his bone marrow showeda 3.1 x  3.6 cm skull lesion with extension into the scalp and intracranial cavity with mass effect on the brain, significant progressive metastatic disease, with innumerable new and enlarging lesions. Lesions in the proximal left and right humerus, distal right femur, and proximal left femur are at risk of pathological fracture. The vertebral body of C2 had been nearly completely replaced, and there was a large soft tissue mass in the anterolateral left chest wall. At that time, he was switched to KPD (carfilzomib, pomalyst, and dexamethasone), which he has been receiving since. His last doses of Carfilzomib were 12/8-9. His last dose of decadron was 12/10. His last dose of Pomalyst was 12/14.  - Radiation therapy 3000 cGy to skull (8/2021-9/2021), and radiation therapy 800 cGy to bilat shoulders, pelvis, bilat hips (9/2021).  - Labs 12/15 show M-spike 0.1, KFLC 1.24, K/L ratio 1.72. Bone marrow 12/17 is negative by flow. Brain MRI on 12/18/21 shows improvement; left parietal bone lesion is now 2cm, with no mass effect on the brain. LP on 12/22 showed 0 unclassified cells  - Plan to start GCSF 1/8/22, and draw CD34 on 1/11/22. Hickman will be placed 1/6/21.    #Heme:   - Monitor counts and transfuse as needed. Standard transfusion thresholds, hct <26%, platelets <11,000.No premeds required.    #ID:   - The patient will have standard infectious disease screenings and will be started on peri-transplant prophylaxis as per standard protocol.   - Switched from acyclovir to valacyclovir     #FEN:   - Oral intake is good.   - Started on Calcium with Vit D     #GI  - Liver looked abnormal on ECHO 12/22/21. Liver ultrasound will be done this afternoon.    #Extensive bone disease, risk for pathological fracture:   - Ortho consult 1/6/22 to assess, specifically the lesions in his bilateral proximal humeri, left proximal femur, and right distal femur.     #Dental   - Oral med appointment on 12/23 revealed a loose tooth that  is recommended to be extracted, however the patient is at high risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw due to Zometa use. They plan to attempt to stabilize the tooth rather than extract it, if possible.  - Follow up appointment with oral med for cleaning, take antibiotics prior as ordered  -We will defer to oral med on whether this tooth needs to be extracted, but hope to not push back our planned transplant dates.       All findings discussed with Dr. Deatra Canter, who is in agreement with this plan.      Signature: Haroldine Laws, ARNP"

Eyes:      Extraocular Movements: Extraocular movements intact.   Cardiovascular:      Rate and Rhythm: Normal rate and regular rhythm.      Pulses: Normal pulses.   Pulmonary:      Effort: Pulmonary effort is normal.   Skin:     General: Skin is warm and dry.      Capillary Refill: Capillary refill takes less than 2 seconds.   Neurological:      General: No focal deficit present.      Mental Status: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.   Psychiatric:         Mood and Affect: Mood normal.         Behavior: Behavior normal.     MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Focused exam of the bilateral lower extremities:   No tenderness about the bilateral proximal femurs.  No pain with logroll or passive range of motion   Sensation intact to light touch over the  leg, foot and toes including the saphenous, sural, tibial, deep peroneal and superficial peroneal nerve distributions   Active plantar flexion/dorsiflexion of the ankle and toes   Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses are palpable   Capillary refill <3 sec at the toes   Calf is soft and non-tender     MEDICAL DECISION MAKING  IMAGING  Radiographs :   Osseous survey done on 12/2021 independently reviewed by me and demonstrates a small lucent region within the left greater trochanter. No intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric, or  femoral shaft lesions at risk for fracture. There are no humeral lesions at risk for fracture.    PET :  PET/CT done on 12/30/2021 independently reviewed by me and demonstrates there are no femoral lesions at risk for pathologic fracture. There are humeral lesions at risk for pathologic fracture.  ________________________________________________________________________________________    ASSESSMENT: No current evidence of risk for pathologic fracture.    DISCUSSION: I discussed with the patient that the MRI indicated a possible risk of fracture, but based on the radiographs and CT scan as well as him being asymptomatic, I do not believe there is any risk for fracture and no treatment is recommended.    PLAN: I recommended that the patient let his physician now if he should develop pain in his arms or legs. Otherwise, he can return to see Korea as needed.    Documented by Hollice Espy was encouraged to ask questions throughout the visit and they were answered as clearly and thoroughly as possible.  By the end of the visit, they demonstrated understanding of and agreement with the treatment plan.

He had been n.p.o. all morning for line placement.  Except for this isolated incident, he has had no weakness, no falls, no syncopal episodes.  He is feeling strong today    He had a new Hickman line placed yesterday.  He noticed some tenderness at the insertion site at first, but that has resolved.  He denies fever, chills, drainage from insertion site.  He will have the dressing changed today. He denies nausea, diarrhea, cough, SOB, fever, and sick contacts.

Treated with CyBorD (3/2019-11/2019).  -In 11/2019 his M-spike was 0.6 with beta 2 microglobulin of 1.5. His M-spike went down to 0.3.MRI at this time showed pathological fractures of T3, T6, and T8, with multiple lesions in the skull, axial, and appendicular skeleton. The lesions in his bilateral proximal humeri were at risk for pathological fracture. Treated withRevlimid (12/2019-4/2020),thenRVd (4/20-5/20), thendara-RVd (6/2020-4/2021).   -From 4/2021 to 7/2021, he went back on CyBorD. In 6/2021, he had kappa FLC of 20.78, lambda FLC of 0.24, kappa/lambda ratio of 86.58. CT showed axillary and retroperitonealadenopathy, as well as an increasingleft skullmass.  -PET/CT in 8/2021 showed multiple new sites of disease, with 4.8cm enhancing frontoparietal skull mass. MRIof his bone marrow showeda 3.1 x 3.6 cm skull lesion with extension into the scalp and intracranial cavity with mass effect on the brain,significant progressive metastatic disease, with innumerable new and enlarging lesions. Lesions in the proximal left and right humerus, distal right femur, and proximal left femur are at risk of pathological fracture. The vertebral body of C2 had been nearly completely replaced, and there was a large soft tissue mass in the anterolateral left chest wall. At that time, he was switched to KPD (carfilzomib, pomalyst, and dexamethasone), which he has been receiving since. His last doses of Carfilzomib were 12/8-9. His last dose of decadron was 12/10. His last dose of Pomalyst was 12/14.  - Radiation therapy 3000 cGy to skull (8/2021-9/2021), and radiation therapy 800 cGy to bilat shoulders, pelvis, bilat hips (9/2021).  - Labs 12/15 show M-spike 0.1, KFLC 1.24, K/L ratio 1.72. Bone marrow 12/17 is negative by flow. Brain MRI on 12/18/21 shows improvement; left  parietal bone lesion is now 2cm, with no mass effect on the brain.LP on 12/22 showed 0 unclassified cells  - Plan to start GCSF 1/8/22, and draw CD34 on 1/11/22. Hickman was placed 1/6/21.    #Heme:  - Monitor counts and transfuse as needed.Standard transfusion thresholds, hct <26%, platelets <11,000.No premeds required.    #ID:  -The patient will have standard infectious disease screenings and will be started on peri-transplant prophylaxis as per standard protocol.  -Ppx: valacyclovir    #FEN:  - Oral intake is good.  - on Calcium + Vit D     #GI  - Liver looked abnormal on ECHO 12/22/21. Liver ultrasound showed normal vasculature, fatty liver.  LFTs normal  - Hepatitis B surface antibody reactive, Intl Units 38.60. **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** HBV PCR sent.  Hepatitis A IgG antibodies reactive,  IgM antibodies nonreactive.  Hepatitis C antibodies nonreactive.    #Extensive bone disease, risk for pathological fracture:  -Ortho consult was done1/6/22to assess, specifically the lesions in his bilateral proximal humeri, left proximal femur, and right distal femur.  Per the patient, they do not feel he is at high risk of pathological fracture.  The consult note is not yet in the chart.    #Dental   - Oral med appointment on 12/23 revealed a loose tooth that is recommended to be extracted, however the patient is at high risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw due to Zometa use. They plan to attempt to stabilize the tooth rather than extract it, if possible.  - Follow up appointment with oral med 1/14 for cleaning, take antibiotics prior as ordered  -We will defer to oral med on whether this tooth needs to be extracted, but hope to not push back our planned transplant dates.

Treated with CyBorD ( **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** 3/2019-11/2019).  - Treated withRevlimid (12/2019-4/2020),thenRVd (4/20-5/20),  thendara-RVd (6/2020-4/2021).   -From 4/2021 to 7/2021, he went back on CyBorD. In 6/2021, he had kappa FLC of 20.78, lambda FLC of 0.24, kappa/lambda ratio of 86.58. CT showed axillary and retroperitonealadenopathy, as well as an increasingleft skullmass.  -PET/CT in 8/2021 showed multiple new sites of disease, with 4.8cm enhancing frontoparietal skull mass. MRIof his bone marrow showeda 3.1 x 3.6 cm skull lesion with extension into the scalp and intracranial cavity with mass effect on the brain,significant progressive metastatic disease, with innumerable new and enlarging lesions. Lesions in the proximal left and right humerus, distal right femur, and proximal left femur are at risk of pathological fracture. The vertebral body of C2 had been nearly completely replaced, and there was a large soft tissue mass in the anterolateral left chest wall. At that time, he was switched to KPD (carfilzomib, pomalyst, and dexamethasone), which he has been receiving since. His last doses of Carfilzomib were 12/8-9. His last dose of decadron was 12/10. His last dose of Pomalyst was 12/14.  - Radiation therapy 3000 cGy to skull (8/2021-9/2021), and radiation therapy 800 cGy to bilat shoulders, pelvis, bilat hips (9/2021).  -Continue GCSF 1/8/22, CD34 on 1/11/22.     #Heme:  -Leukocytosis status post G-CSF.  Continue daily labs through collection.  -No transfusions indicated today.  Standard transfusion thresholds, hct <26%, platelets <11,000.No premeds required.    #ID:  - Afebrile.  No active infections.  -Ppx: valacyclovir    #RRT  -Bone pain (lower back/right knee).  Likely the results of G-CSF administration.  Continue as needed Tylenol.  Patient reminded to take temperature prior to taking and to notify team if pain worsens.    #FEN:  -Good oral intake.   -Hypomagnesmia.  Starting on 1 tab p.o. mag oxide daily in anticipation of a pheresis.  -Hypophosphatemia.  Starting on potassium phosphate  packets.    #Other medical concerns:  - Liver lookedabnormal on ECHO 12/22/21. Liver ultrasound showed normal vasculature, fatty liver.  LFTs normal.  - Hepatitis B surface antibody reactive, Intl Units 38.60.  HBV PCR sent.  Hepatitis A IgG antibodies reactive,  IgM antibodies nonreactive.  Hepatitis C antibodies nonreactive.  -Concern for pathologic fracture. Ortho consult was done1/6/22to assess, specifically the lesions in his bilateral proximal humeri, left proximal femur, and right distal femur.  Note currently remains pending.  Per patient they do not feel risk for pathological fracture is high at this time.  No further follow-up unless patient becomes symptomatic.    -Tooth extraction.  Will have dental cleaning and possible extraction prior to transplant.  Follow-up oral medicine appointment on 1/14.    #Plan:  -CD34 tomorrow 1/11.  -Continue daily labs.  -Monitor lower back and right knee pain.  -Closely monitor electrolytes in anticipation of apheresis.  Pick up and start taking magnesium oxide and potassium phosphate.    Signature: Maximino Greenland, PA-C"

The majority of time was spent counseling and coordinating the care of the patient.  I spent a total of 110 minutes from 11-12:40 discussing with him his workup and how we are going to mobilize stem cells.      Briefly, he is a 90 year old gentleman with multiple myeloma.  We  first summarize his workup and then we  discuss with him about collecting with growth factor alone his auto PBSC stem cells.  His donor virology negative, A positive, HIV P24 negative, CMV seropositive, HSV1 seropositive, 2 seronegative, VZV seropositive.  Testosterone is low at 39.3, which we discussed, he will follow up with his doc post Covel at home and if  it is not medically contraindicated after transplant, he can be supplemented.  His cholesterol was 236, triglycerides 194.  We asked it to be repeated fasting.  UA was negative except for epithelials.   QuantiFERON was negative, AIC 5.4.  His retic count was 3.4.  Ferritin was 164.  Rest of iron studies were okay.  Coags were okay.  Vitamin D was normal 33.2.  His COVID-19, his NPT has been negative here.  His PSA was 0.36.  Peripheral blood flow was negative of note . Though, his bone marrow was a poor sample along the right and left also had  artifact, but reportedly was negative by what was there that they could review by path and flow and classic cytogenetics were still pending, although the sample is so poor, I am not sure what to make out of it to be honest with you. Cytogenetics finally came back now as negative.   LP was negative, cytospin did have some lymphocytes and monocytes   reactive.  His kappa was 1.24, lambda 0.72, kappa lambda 1.72.  His m spike was  IgG kappa was 0.1.  His 24-hour urine had a creatinine clearance of 169, immunofixation was negative of note, though there was no total protein as it was not ordered correctly.  IgA of 64, IgG of 537, IgM of 13.  C-reactive  protein protein was 4.4, beta 2 microglobulin of 1.3 and original outside  plasmacytoma biopsy also had not been read yet by pathology here and I did get the slides here and got them to read it and it was confirmed a plasmacytoma on the 03/2019 outside slides .  His PFTs show an FEV1/FVC of 75, FEV1 of 81, FEV1/FVC of 89, DLCO corrected was 83%.  Chest x-ray had a few old healing bilateral rib fractures.  EKG normal sinus, QTc of 419 and echo of 72% with a GLS of approximately -20.1%, had some left wall thickness in the left ventricle that was mild and his ISS looks to be about 12.      In terms of his scans, it looks like my predecessor sent him  to see ortho based on an  PET report, although his  Osseous survey does not  look that bad  and of note the patient was already radiated in both of the arms, as well as in the hip area.  Patient denies any pain and orth when saw agreed no need to do anything  Currently and just follow .  His MRI of his brain shows a 2 cm left parietal foci that extends medially along the inner table with apparent slight dural enhancement.  He also has some microvascular age related changes. **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** Of note, the patient did have radiation already to this  skull lesion .  He had an ultrasound of his abdomen because he had the fatty liver and again that is what they saw,   his hepatitis panel through Blood works was negative.  He had an osseous survey that showed lytic lesions in the calvarium, proximal left femur, mild compression deformity at T6.  The femur measured about 1.2 cm and the largest in the skull was 2.5, T6 did not have measurable size called.  He had a PET CT that showed a focal lesion in the left parietal bone with some mild uptake, a front left maxillary, questionable whether he had some dental issues.  Of note, the patient does have a tooth that dentist are trying to salvage because they are afraid if they pull it, he will have osteonecrosis in the area, but the plan is for the  dentist to reevaluate post-collection as to when they do a deep cleaning whether if that tooth is just going to fall out on its own.  He had a nonspecific hazy solid nodule of 0.7 cm  in the left upper lobe with mild uptake, although this says it is new since prior studies.  Of note, the patient and his wife, through the interpreter said that they knew they had this and his doc had seen it    at home over nine months ago  and I said as a consequence, since again this is small, that the plan would be if he spikes a fever that we would redo a CT of his chest to see if the area is, changing, but as I said, the patient says he has been told the spring of 2021 that he has this change there.  He had 2 kinds of foci in the peripheral prostate that supposedly had elevated SUVs, but his PSA is normal, so again, I said we would just follow up on this.  He basically had some focal increase in T9.  He had also some increase SUV as well cervical, upper thoracic, left posterior 8th rib,  as well as other bilateral ribs.  He had a large lesion in the left humerus with a minimally displaced fracture.  Please note that he was already radiated.  He had increase in the distal right femur, lytic lesion left sacral, increased bilateral iliac wing by PET, left femoral head about 0.7 cm, sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis and as I said, his PSA was low at 0.36.       We then focused with the patient on the storage contract, which he signed.  We discussed our goal will be to try to collect enough for two transplants to keep future options open, 8-10 million CD34 cells per kilogram.  We discussed that we can not guarantee we will get adequate number of stem cells from him. The patient is charity at the U and SCCA and we did discuss this will be an issue if he gets hospitalized with transplant because of the fact his wife cannot stay with him given   COVID-19  community issue in the hospital.  We have asked the social worker to  look into how to help because of the fact that if she goes home, she will be exposed to people in her household who have not been vaccinated and refuse to be revaccinated and that may be an issue with her returning.  We did discuss with the patient and his wife that our Education officer, museum **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** will get back to him about  If he requires hospitalization during Sunburg his wife having a place to stay in South Carolina .  We discussed it is not a guarantee he will be admitted with a transplant, but about 70% do go in when they spike a fever, their counts are low, they are not eating and drinking well, they have too much GI symptoms , they have pain and need IV nausea meds and IV pain meds.      We did discuss with the patient the apheresis, low risk for infection, bleeding, electrolyte abnormalities causing charley horse, muscle aches, and needing electrolytes supplement that consent  he signed.  We talked about that we cannot guarantee we will collect stem cells, if we are having a hard time we will focus on getting enough for one, 4-5 million CD34 cells per kilogram.  We discussed we can go a lower number to 2-1/2 million CD34 cells per kilogram per TX, but at the lower number we have harder time for engraftment, especially platelets and we did discuss with the patient some of the side effects such as bone pain, headaches, low-grade fevers, rare nausea and vomiting, rare autoimmune disease flareup, very rare splenic bleeding or rupture, very rare flareups of heart problems, arrhthymias,   angina or MIs.  We did discuss that we will check his blood on day 4 for number of Cd34 cells present.  IF  It is low, then we would be recommending to add plerixafor.  Plerixafor has the same side effects of G  But also  Causes  diarrhea in a third of the patients.  We did discuss with the patient he would be looking at one autotransplant followed by consolidation therapy since he has mainly numerous plasmacytoma disease and it may be reasonable to do  something like KPD for b couple of years  As it looks like KPD he was responding to before he came to Korea. If not able get Imid coverage then at least KD  . When all questions were answered, the conference was concluded after signed information sheet/cosent for 656 Stp and generic G consent."

Bilateral largely conductive hearing loss with 30-50 dB air-bone gaps bilaterally.  Excellent word recognition with live voice and Spanish interpreter.  Tympanogram consistent with perforations and middle ear atelectasis.      Imaging and Lab data    MRI brain with contrast December 18, 2021  1. 2 cm left parietal focus of presumed multiple myeloma involvement centered in the diploic space but extending medially along the inner table with apparent slight dural enhancement but without brain parenchymal involvement or mass effect. Smaller nonspecific calvarial foci subcentimeter in size also noted.  2. Brain parenchyma essentially intact with likely incidental note made of small foci of nonenhancing FLAIR high signal presumed microvascular age-related changes.    Clear mastoids and sinuses.    Assessment and Plan:    (H90.0) Conductive hearing loss, bilateral  (primary encounter diagnosis)  (C90.00) Multiple myeloma not having achieved remission (HCC)  (H72.93) Perforation of tympanic membrane, bilateral    We reviewed Mr. Tapia Diarte's audiogram and ear exam in detail today.  I have reassured him that although he has very chronic appearing central perforations there is no evidence of any infection.  I discussed the importance of strict dry ear precautions to minimize any recurrence.      If he does develop infections the optimal treatment would include topical antibiotic eardrops such Ciprodex, 5 to 8 drops twice a day to the affected ear.    He does have a significant conductive hearing loss in both ears.  Because of his chronic perforations he would be a poor candidate for conventional air conduction hearing aids, but would be a good candidate for a bone-anchored hearing device.  He could also use some after shocks headphones in the interim.    If he is otherwise doing well I recommended follow-up in 4 to 6 months to verify that his ears remain free of infection.  We could also discuss possible interventions to assist with his hearing loss."

Also present at the conference was the transplant team nurse and the patients wife. The conference was done in the presence of a Patent attorney.      ONCOLOGIC HISTORY  Please refer to the arrival conference (12/16/21) for details regarding the oncologic history.     Briefly, Mr. Chancelor Hardrick is a 81 year old male with IgG kappa multiple myeloma, originally diagnosed in March 2019 who received CyBorD and completed 6 cycles between 3/2019 - 11/2019. Repeat bone marrow biopsy 10/18/2019 with 5% residual myeloma plasma cells. Evaluated for auto-transplant at Saint Francis Hospital but did not proceed due to lack of insurance coverage. He was then placed on maintenance Revlimid from 12/2019-4/2020. In 11/2020, There were problems with getting the Revlimid reliably and his M-spike began to climb so he was placed back on CyBorD. In 8/2021 showed multiple new sites of disease, with 4.8cm enhancing frontoparietal skull mass. He was switched to KPD (carfilzomib, pomalyst, and dexamethasone). He got radiation therapy to left skull 3000 cGy from 08/31/2021 to 09/08/2021; right shoulder 800 Gy on 09/01; left shoulder 800 Gy 09/02; upper pelvis, bilateral hips 800 Gy 09/03.    The patient has completed pretransplant work up as well as stem cell collection. The results of disease restating and pretransplant work up are summarized below. Of note, his PET scan noted a 0.7 cm mildly FDG avid left upper lobe hazy nodule. A non-contrast CT can be repeated after 4 months, however, if there are respiratory symptoms or he develops a fever post stem cell infusion, a repeat CT chest would be performed. Another incidental finding on the PET scan was presence of 2 foci in the prostate gland with FDG avidity (SUV 10.4). His PSA is low at 0.36. A repeat PSA and  prostate ultrasound should be checked 3 months post-transplant and followed closely.     He had audiology/ ENT appointment which showed bilateral conductive hearing loss and chronic tympanic perforation. There was no evidence of current infection. Recommended to follow up in 4-6 months.       PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  - IgG kappa multiple myeloma  - bilateral TM perforation; has happened multiple times since childhood; per patient, a specialist said surgery is possible, but he declined  - bilateral hearing loss  - kidney stone in 2005     PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  - None     SOCIAL HISTORY:   - No cigarette smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use   - Undocumented immigrant, has been living in the Korea for 23 years  - Married, has 3 children     FAMILY HISTORY:  - No history of myeloma, lymphoma or leukemia  - Mother with DM and HTN      MEDICATIONS:  See medication list     RESTAGING/ PRE-TRANSPLANT WORKUP:  12/15: HSV1 (seropositive), HSV2 (seronegative), CMV (seropositive), VZV (seropositive), HIV (seronegative)    COVID 19 swabs have been negative    Quantiferon test was negative     12/15: SPEP  IgG kappa M spike of 0.1, Kappa light chain  1.24, lambda light chain  0.72.

Smaller nonspecific calvarial foci subcentimeter in size also noted. Microvascular age-related changes.    12/20 Skeletal survey: lytic lesions in the calvarium and proximal left femur. Mild compression fracture deformity of the T6 vertebral body      12/30: PET scan: Impression  Findings are consistent with scattered foci of viable myelomatous disease involving axial and appendicular bones as above. An indeterminant left upper lobe nodule with mild FDG uptake (size 0.7 cm with SUV 2.8). Two FDG avid foci in bilateral peripheral zone of the prostate (SUV 10.4).      COLLECTION: 11.4 x 10(6) CD34 cells/kg after mobilization with G-CSF     PRETRANSPLANT DISEASE STATUS  Very good partial remission      DISCUSSION     After discussing the results of the pretransplant evaluation and stem cell collection, I discussed in detail with the patient the process of autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma.      We discussed that the current standard of care for multiple myeloma patients is to undergo upfront autologous stem cell transplant. I explained the rationale for proceeding with upfront transplant. This approach has been demonstrated in multiple studies in the literature to produce the best progression-free survival and overall survival for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Older studies demonstrated both a benefit in overall survival of 1-1.5 years and an improvement in progression free survival (18-24 months). The most recent trial the IFM209 (Attal, N Engl J Med 2017;376:1311-20) reported that median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group that underwent  transplantation than in the group that received RVD alone (50 months vs. 36 months). However, no overall survival benefit was seen but the study was not mature enough potentially to see a survival difference.  Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 large, randomized trials (Chattahoochee 380-256-6625) that utilized lenalidomide maintenance demonstrated a progression free survival and overall survival benefit.     we reviewed administration of high dose melphalan on Day -2. The Melphalan dose is the standard 200 mg/m2. We infuse the autologous peripheral blood stem cells into the patient approximately 48 hours after completion of the high dose melphalan chemotherapy. I reviewed the potential toxicity from DMSO and the infusion of autologous peripheral blood stem cells. DMSO may cause hypotension or hypertension, flushing, shortness of breath and cardiac arrhythmias. Serious reactions include hemolysis and kidney injury, which is typically reversible, allergic reaction including skin rash and a Stevens-Johnson type syndrome. In rare instances, it can lead to neurological symptoms (stroke like symptoms/ seizures) or even fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The DMSO has a foul odor, **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** and the patients breathe off the DMSO over the day or two after the stem cell infusion. Complications of chemotherapy begin at around the time of stem cell infusion with nausea and vomiting through the remainder of the first week.       Other complications of chemotherapy include, but are not limited to, mucositis, severe diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, infections, organ failure, including cardiac, renal, or pulmonary organ failure or damage. Most likely reason one might have a life-threatening complication of transplant would be an infection due to severe myelosuppression, which can be prolonged or organ failure.        I described the myelosuppression and complications occurring in the 2nd and 3rd third weeks of the transplant month.  Patients may feel extremely ill and fatigued, ambulation may be quite limited, and many patients require admission for hydration, parenteral nutrition, intravenous antibiotics, and pain control for mucositis. Pseudo GVHD may occur. On approximately Day 10-14 the myelosuppression begins to lift and blood counts begin to improve. Patients no longer require transfusions, infections disappear, mucositis and diarrhea resolve, and patients generally begin to feel better and ambulate more. By Days 21-28 most patients are again ambulatory and are discharged from the hospital if they had been admitted. Visits continue on an outpatient basis on an every-day to every 2-3 day basis, depending on the patient's recovery from transplant.  Patients are usually discharged from the Transplant service by Day 28-30. If there are complications patients may remain on the service longer. Once discharged from the Transplant Service we recommend that patients be followed weekly for 4 weeks with CMV monitoring and then every other week for 1 month.        Treatment-related mortality for an autologous stem cell transplant for myeloma at our center is 1% to 2%.  I noted to the patient that it could take up to 3 to feel 90% to 100% of normal physically and mentally after the transplant. Generally, patients recover much more quickly than that though and are 75-90% within 2-3 months of the transplant. The patient understood, agreed and decided to move forward with transplant.        I described that the transplant team consists of RNs, APPs, and physicians who rotate every few weeks. We also reviewed several consents today which the patient signed.    I spent a total of approximately 75 minutes with the patient in face-to-face discussion on the management of his cancer and coordination of care."

Liver UKorea12/28 - normal vasculature, fatty liver. Hepatitis panel 12/30 negative.       PRE-TRANSPLANT CONSULTATIONS:   1. Otolaryngology - referred for a hisotry of chronic ear perforations and ear infections causing hearing loss. He was seen by Dr. CArnoldo Hookeron 1/13/2022 where an audiogram was done showing bilateral largely conductive hearing loss and a Tympanogram consistent with perforations and middle ear atelectasis. Given his chronic appearring central perforations, it was recommend he use Ciprodex 5-8 drops twice a day to the affected ear as needed. For his hearing loss, he would be a good candidate for bone anchored hearing device. Recommended follow up in 4-6 months to discuss possible interventions to assist with hearing and verify that his ears remain clear of infection.     2. Orthopedics- referred for concerning size of myeloma lesions bilateral proximal humeri, left proximal femur, and right distal femur.Note currently remains unsigned, but incomplete note suggests no further evaluation warranted unless patient beomes symptomatic with pain in his arms or legs.    3. Oral Medicine-  Referred for pre transplant clearance. Seen on 12/23 - needed a cleaning prior to transplant. Tooth #20 will need further assessment post transplant around day 40-50.    PRE-TRANSPLANT COMPLICATIONS   N/a.     POST-TRANSPLANT COMPLICATIONS **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** 1. Right lower lip HSV1. Positive culture 2/2. Valtrex increased to TID 2/3-2/9. Lesion resolved.   2. Oral thrush noted on 2/2. QID nystatin course completed.   3. Non neutropenic low grade fever 2/4. CXR, Urine/blood cultures negative. Ceftriaxone x1 2/4.  4. Pulmonary nodule noted on pre transplant PET/CT: for follow up on patient's left upper lobe pulmonary nodule, a chest CT was done 2/23 which showed ""cluster of at least 3 nodules measuring 3 to 4 mm in the left lung upper  lobe."" We discussed the case with our colleagues in infectious disease who were reassured by nodules smaller size and clearer appearance despite having gone through his transplant. Given his negative quantiferon pre-transplant the ddx would probably be endemic fungi so a serum cryptococcal antigen, coccidiodes antibody, and histoplasmosis fungal serology was drawn 2/24/22 to look for past exposures. If none of these are positive,  repeat imaging is recommended in ~4month as well as repeat quantiferon to confirm that as a true negative (>3-68mo      PERTINENT PAST MEDICAL HISTORY   1.

But briefly, Mr. Tilden Fossa initially presented in  March 2019 with back pain and chest pain for 10 days.  A CT scan was obtained showing lytic bone lesions and a subsequent biopsy of the left 3rd rib lesion showed a plasmacytoma **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** and baseline labs showing an IgG kappa monoclonal protein of 6 g/dL, with kappa light chain of 65, lambda of 0.34 and ratio of 190.  He then completed 7 cycles of CyBorD achieving a VGPR with initial plan for transplant  But did not pursue this due to issues with insurance coverage.  He was switched to lenalidomide maintenance until disease progression at which time he resumed RVD, then RVD+daratumumab, CyBorD, KPD and palliative radiation.  He underwent Mel200/ASCT on 1/21/2022 and is now D+32.    He reports that currently his energy is okay.  He has no pain and requires no pain medications.  He has no infection.

Heart and great vessels:  Right chest wall Port-A-Cath with its tip in the mid SVC. Tunneled central venous line terminates in the right atrium.    Lungs:  There is a cluster of at least 3 nodules measuring 3 to 4  mm-sized in the left lung upper lobe, previously measured as a single nodule on limited low-dose attenuation correction CT with corresponding FDG uptake.  Few scattered calcified granulomas.    Pleura:  Unremarkable.    Chest wall:  Unremarkable.    Upper abdomen:  Diffuse hepatic steatosis.    Bones:  Widespread lytic osseous lesions, consistent with known multiple myeloma. Mild compression deformities of T3 and T6 vertebral bodies, similar to prior. Old pathologic fractures of multiple bilateral ribs  Impression: Cluster of at least 3 nodules measuring 3 to 4 mm in the left lung upper lobe, with FDG uptake on prior study dated 12/30/2021. These are favored to represent an infectious/ inflammatory process (including bacterial or fungal infection). Recommend short interval follow-up CT chest in 3 months to ensure resolution.

COMPARISON:  Previous PET/CT Scan: None.  Other comparison studies: CT chest 7/8/2021.    TECHNIQUE:  Extent: Whole body.  The patient was in a fasting state at the time of the study.  Risks and benefits of the  procedure were explained to the patient.  Emission acquisition time per bed: 2.5 minutes.  Blood glucose level: 101 mg/dL.  Uptake time: 60 minutes.    The attenuation correction CT scan, acquired as part of this study, is limited by lack of contrast administration and is not a dedicated diagnostic study.  The CT scan is not breath held.  This CT scan is acquired for attenuation correction and anatomic localization purposes.    RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL:    FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE F-18 FDG UWM UWM HBZJIRCVE,9.3 millicurie YBOFBPZWCHE,52/77/8242 1648.    FINDINGS:    Liver mean SUV: 2.1  Mediastinal blood pool max SUV: 3.7  Mediastinal blood pool mean SUV: 2.2    Head and neck:  A focal lytic lesion in the left parietal bone demonstrate mild FDG uptake (PET image 31, CT image 36).    A soft tissue density centered at the defect of the frontal left maxilla with increased FDG uptake (SUV 22.8) like representing inflammatory/infectious dental disease.    Chest:  A nonspecific hazy solid nodule measuring 0.7 cm in the left upper lobe (4/18) with mild FDG uptake (SUV 2.8, PET image 107), new since prior study.     Abdomen and Pelvis:  Two FDG avid foci in bilateral peripheral zone of prostate with max SUV of 10.4.    Osseous structures:    Diffuse increased FDG uptake of the vertebral body likely representing reactive bone marrow limits evaluation for focal lesions. There is focal increased FDG uptake of T9 vertebral body, suspicious for residual viable disease.    Increased FDG uptake in the spinous processes of the lower cervical and upper thoracic vertebral bodies, suspicious for viable disease.    Increased focal FDG uptake of left posterior eighth rib (PET image 162), suspicious for residual bowel disease.  Additional multiple foci of increased FDG uptake in bilateral ribs with corresponding fractures, likely reactive.    A large lytic lesion within the proximal diaphysis of left humerus with anterior cortical  disruption representing minimally displaced fracture (CT image 107) with mild FDG uptake, suspicious for viable disease.    Increased FDG uptake of distal right femur (PET image 358) with soft tissue density replacing the fatty marrow (CT image 403), likely residual viable disease.    Lytic lesion within the left sacral wing.    Increased FDG uptake in the bilateral iliac wing, suspicious for viable disease.    A focal sclerotic lesion within the left femoral head measuring 0.7 cm with mild FDG uptake.    Extremities:  No suspicious FDG uptake.    Additional findings on attenuation correction CT scan:    Persistent diffuse hepatic steatosis.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.    IMPRESSION    Findings are consistent with scattered foci of viable myelomatous disease involving axial and appendicular bones as above.  Evaluation of vertebral bodies is limited due to diffuse bone marrow uptake likely secondary to prior G-CSF treatment. Recommend subsequent FDG PET study to be performed at least 12-14 days post GCSF injection in order to avoid this limitation.    An indeterminant left upper lobe nodule with **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** mild FDG uptake. This could be a focus of inflammation or less likely an early cancer. Recommend non-contrast CT chest in 4 months for further evaluation looking for interval growth.    Two FDG avid foci in bilateral peripheral zone of the prostate. Differential includes prostate cancer until proven otherwise. Recommend correlation with PSA and prostate ultrasound scan.    I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the report (or as edited).           ASSESSMENT/PLAN    1.  IgG kappa multiple myeloma  2.  Stem cell transplant status    Mr. Phillips Climes is a 32 year old gentleman with relapsed/refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma, baseline FISH and R-ISS stage unknown who is now D+32 from Mel200/ASCT.  Her pre-transplant labs were notable for an IgG kappa M-spike and normal FLC ratio and  bone marrow biopsy with no evidence of involvement by a plasma cell neoplasm; cytogenetics were normal and FISH was not performed given that there were no abnormal plasma cells on the aspirate sample.    He tolerated his transplant and is recovering well so far.  We discussed maintenance therapy, favoring maintenance with either pomalidomide or carfilzomib.    He will be following up with his primary oncologist, Dr. Berline Lopes, in Blanchester, next appointment is scheduled for 3/2/2022.  We recommended continued clinic visit and labs, as outlined by the transplant team, and post-transplant workup at D+80-90.  We recommend maintenance therapy to begin after this post-transplant assessment, with continued maintenance until disease progression or dose limiting toxicity.     - weekly clinic visit and labs (CBC and CMP) for 4 weeks, then every other week for weeks   - CMV PCR weekly until D+60   - post-transplant assessment at D+80-90, including bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, cytogenetics, FISH, osseous survey, bone marrow MRI, 24h UPEP/IFE, SPEP/IFE, free light chains and quantitative immunoglobulins   - recommend continued bone modifying agent, with Zometa every 4 weeks for total 2 years, per current ASCO clinical practice guidelines, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation   - we recommend beginning maintenance therapy after his post-transplant disease assessment is complete, around D+90-100. Given that he was treated with KPD prior to his transplant with response, favor maintenance therapy with either carfilzomib (I.e. 36 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, 15, 16 of 28 days) or with pomalidomide (4 mg PO on days 1-21 of 28 with aspirin 325 mg daily or other anticoagulant, Paludo J, et al. Blood. 2017 Sep 7;130(10):1198-1204).   - continue acyclovir for viral prophylaxis    Thank you very much for the kind referral this patient to our clinic.  He will be returning for ongoing post-transplant follow-up and care with you in Fillmore County Hospital.  Please do not hesitate to reach out should any questions or concerns arise about his care.  He has the clinic contact information including the phone number for the myeloma nurses at 314-067-1100.    I spent a total time of 45 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which more than 50% was spent counseling and coordinating care as outlined in this note."

Today, I had the pleasure of meeting your patient, Mr. Davarious Tumbleson, who came together with his wife, and the conference was held in the presence of a Spanish interpreter, as well as an Therapist, sports for the Outpatient Autologous Transplant Team.  This conference was meant to summarize the details of the autologous transplant and the plan for transferring his care back to your service.    THE PRETRANSPLANT WORKUP:   1.  For Multiple Myeloma.   a.  Peripheral blood flow cytometry on 12/15/2021 was negative for involvement by myeloma cells.  b.  Bone marrow biopsy on 12/17/2021 was negative by flow cytometry.  Pathology showed normal cellular bone marrow with no evidence of disease.  Cytogenetics were normal.   c.  Osseous survey on 12/20/2021 shows lesions in the left femur, bilateral humeri, T6 compression fracture, lytic lesions biggest was 2.5 cm.  d.  A PET CT scan on 12/30/2021 showed new FDG avid foci in the prostate.  There were scattered foci of visible myeloma, left femoral head lesion 0.7 cm, new left upper lobe hazy solid nodule 0.7 cm.  The decision was for pulmonary nodules to repeat chest CT if the patient spikes temperature; otherwise on day +30.  For the prostate uptake, he had a followup PSA reflexive that was 0.36.  Therefore, the decision was made for no further workup.  e.  Brain MRI on 12/18/2021 showed a 2 cm left parietal bone mass; previously was 4 cm and multiple smaller lesions in the skull.  Because of the finding, a diagnostic lumbar puncture was done on 12/22/2021 with 0  unclassified cells and no plasma cells on flow cytometry.  f.  SPEP on 12/20/2021 showed M-spike of 0.1.  Free light chains: kappa free light chain was 1.24 and kappa/lambda ratio was 1.72.  Immunoglobulin levels:  IgG was 537, IgA 64, IgM 13.  g.  UPEP on 12/20/2021:  Creatinine clearance was 169.  There were no M-spike protein detected.  h.  Second organ  function test.  i.  EKG on 12/16/202021:  78 pulse per minute and normal sinus rhythm.   j.  Echocardiogram 12/22/2021:  Left ventricle size is slightly small.  Ejection fraction 72%.  Liver appears abnormal.  Because of that, a liver ultrasound was done on 12/28/2021 that showed normal vasculature, but fatty liver.   k.  He had hepatitis panel that was positive for antibodies, but on 01/07/2022, hepatitis B virus PCR was negative.    OTORHINOLOGY:  The patient was referred for history of chronic ear perforations and ear infection causing hearing loss.  He was seen by Dr. Arnoldo Hooker on 01/13/2022 where an audiogram was done showing bilateral largely conductive hearing loss and a tympanogram consistent with perforation middle ear atelectasis.  Given his chronic appearing central perforation, it was recommended to use Ciprodex, 5-8 drops twice a day to the affected area as needed.  For his hearing loss, he would be  a good candidate for a bone-anchored hearing device.  It was recommended followup in 4-6 months to discuss possible interventions to assist with hearing and verify that his ears remain clear of infection.    ORTHOPEDICS:  The patient was referred for concerning signs of myeloma lesion, bilateral proximal humeri, left proximal femur and right distal femur.  The notes suggest no further evaluation is warranted unless the patient becomes symptomatic.    ORAL MEDICINE:  He needed **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** cleaning prior to transplant.  Tooth #20 will need further assessment post-transplant around day 40-50 per Oral Medicine.    MOBILIZATION AND COLLECTION OF STEM CELLS:  1.  He received G-CSF 16 mcg/kg two times a day starting from 01/08/2022 until 01/11/2022.  2.  He then had the collection of stem cells on 01/11/2022 and 01/12/2022, and he collected over 2 days, 11.4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg body weight.  3.  High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant.  He received melphalan 200 mg/MSQ on 01/19/2022, and he received his  stem cell infusion on 01/21/2022.  He received 5.68 x 106 CD34 cells/kg body weight, which was equivalent to 1.11 x 109 TNC/kg body weight.  He was infused 2 bags over 1 day.    POST TRANSPLANT EVENTS:  1.  Non-neutropenic low-grade fever.  On 02/04/2022, chest x-ray, urine, and blood cultures were negative.  He received ceftriaxone for only 1 day on 02/04/2022.  2.  Oral thrush noted on 02/02/2022.  A four times a day, nystatin course was completed.  3.  Right lower lip, HSV 1 that was positive culture on 02/02/2022.  Valacyclovir was increased to three times a day between 02/03/2022-02/09/2022, and the lesion that was resolved.  4.  He received post-transplant G-CSF between 01/26/2022 and 01/31/2022.  5.  He developed nausea and diarrhea, though recovered.  6.  He had gastric reflux.  He was on pantoprazole, currently not required.    CURRENT PROBLEMS:  1.  Follow up of pulmonary nodules.  As indicated above, there was a pulmonary nodule detected on PET/CT scan before transplant.  We repeated the CT scan recently, on 02/23/2022, that showed a cluster of at least 3 nodules measuring 3-4 cm in the left lung upper lobe with FDG uptake on prior study dated 12/30/2021.  The CT scan was done on 02/23/2022.  We consulted ID who thought that these nodules are very small, and they have not really changed through transplant, which is very reassuring.  They think that they almost just look a little clearer rather than larger on the newer images.  The feeling was that since he had a negative QuantiFERON pretransplant, diagnosis would probably be endemic fungi rather than Aspergillus.  We sent for  cryptococcal antigen, coccidioides antibody, and histoplasmosis fungal serology; that was sent for 02/24/2022, and the results are not back yet.  This will be updated to your office later.  The plan was, if any of these are positive, followup with Infectious Disease is recommended.  If none of these are positive, then repeat imaging  is recommended at 3 months from now, as well as repeat QuantiFERON to confirm that it was a true negative.  2.  As mentioned above, the patient might need followup with ENT in 4-6 months for possible intervention to assist with healing and verify that his ears remain clear of infection.  He could be a good candidate for a bone-anchored hearing device.  He is prescribed in his medication.  Ciprofloxacin drops to treat inflammation for twice daily for 7 days.  The last date will be 02/28/2022.  3.  Orthopedic.  His myeloma lesions; if he experiences any pain, he can consult with Orthopedics again.  4.  Follow up with Oral Medicine for tooth #20 is recommended around day 40-50.    MEDICATIONS:  Please see attached medication list    VACCINATIONS:   Unless contraindicated, the patient should get COVID-19 vaccine 3 months after Day 0, then a third dose **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** 28 days later, then a 4th dose is recommended 6 months after the third dose. Patient should also get the seasonal flu vaccine, no sooner than 6 months post-transplant and, thereafter, yearly. Other vaccinations or boosters should be deferred until 1 year post-transplant. Household contacts should also be encouraged to get a flu shot. For patients who return to the Surgery Center Of Gilbert for a one-year anniversary appointment, the first shots will be given and a schedule provided. Immunizations include:   o Haemophilus type B vaccines, 3 doses, given 2 months apart   o Meningococcal vaccine against serogroups ACWY, 2 doses, given 2 months apart.  o Prevnar-13, 3 doses, given 2   months apart.    o Pneumovax, 1 dose, given at least 6 months after the last Prevnar  o Inactivated polio, 3 doses, given 2 months apart  o Hepatitis A, 2 doses, 6 months apart  o Hepatitis B, 3 doses at the standard frequency (0, 2, and 6 months)   o Tdap, 1 dose, followed at 2 months and 4 months by Td    o For age 76-59 years old, HPV vaccine, 3 doses at 0, 2 and 6 months  o For ages 68-25 yoa, consider Bexsero 2  doses, 2 months apart     Vaccination with live-virus vaccines is contraindicated until the patient is at least 2 years out of transplant (for MMR) or 5 years out of transplant (for Zostavax), in addition to meeting other criteria.  Maintenance therapy may delay dead or live vaccines further.  For any questions regarding vaccinations please contact our LTFU office.    ADDITIONAL POST-TRANSPLANT RECOMMENDATIONS:    1. The patient should be followed weekly for four weeks, followed by every other week for another month.  At each visit he should have a history and physical exam, CBC, and basic metabolic panel.  2. He should also have CMV antigenemia checked weekly until day 60 post-transplant.   3. He should undergo complete restaging of his myeloma at approximately day 80 following transplant. The day 80 evaluation should include a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and FISH, an osseous survey, bone marrow MRI, 24-hour urine evaluation for protein and Bence Jones component, serum protein electropheresis with immunofixation, serum free light chain evaluation, quantitative immunoglobulins, as well as any other tests deemed necessary. Depending on the patients restaging results, consideration could be given to placing the patient on maintenance therapy, the type of which will be discussed by Dr. Eldridge Scot but in general we use lenalidomide 10 mg PO daily (can increase to 15 mg if tolerated) or bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks until intolerance or relapse of MM given results of STAMINA trial showing benefit of continuing maintenance treatment beyond 2 years. If he is placed on maintenance lenalidomide, consideration should be given to prophylactic anticoagulation; at minimum, aspirin should be used.   4. The patient should continue zolendronic acid, the dose and frequency can be decided by Dr. Lianne Bushy but in general we use 4 mg IV monthly for first year. Then evaluate by osseous scan/PET and  DEXA scan and either stop if no problems, use zometa every 3 months if remaining lytic lesions, or use zometa every 6-12 months if only osteopenia/osteoporosis.. This will reduce the risk for skeletal-related events associated with his multiple myeloma.  5. The patient's immune system will be compromised for at least 6 to 12 months, and he should therefore avoid any elective dental procedures for the first year.  He should **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** remain on oral valacyclovir for the first year after transplant to prevent shingles with possible extension if for example on lenalidomide, and oral Bactrim DS twice weekly until six months after transplant.  6. We recommend that the patient return to be seen in the LTFU Unit at the Pulaski at his one-year transplant anniversary.  This should be scheduled several months in advance as the appointments tend to fill up quickly.  7. The patient should not have any elective dental procedures performed for at least 6 months post-transplant. If urgent dental work is needed, broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics should be used. Thereafter, he may require more frequent teeth cleaning every 3-4 months, as there is an increased risk of dental problems.   8. He should have annual ophthalmologic evaluations since he is at increased risk for developing cataracts.  9. He should have an annual thyroid function testing since he is at increased risk for hypothyroidism.  10. He should have an annual DEXA scan since he is at increased risk for osteoporosis.  11. He should have routine dermatologic evaluations since he is at increased risk for secondary skin cancers.  He should also use protective measures to minimize sun exposure including the use of SPF-30 or greater sunblock, hats, and other protective clothing.  12. He should have annual testing of testosterone levels since he is at increased risk for hypogonadism.  13. He should be monitored for rare secondary malignancies including acute  myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.  66. He should also have routine screening for other malignancies such as colonoscopy for colon cancer and PSA for prostate cancer.  15. If the patient requires any blood transfusions, he should receive irradiated and leuko-reduced blood products.

If disease is resistant to daratumumab, consider:            - carfilzomib/pomalidomide/dex    Plan  Reviewed with Dr. Billie Ruddy, emailed her recommendations to Dr. Rutherford Nail:    Hello Dr. Rutherford Nail,    I apologize for the delayed response. I reviewed Mr. Tapia Diartes case with our Autologous LTFU attending, Dr. Haynes Hoehn, and she considers his myeloma to be progressing with the evidence of the increased M-spike. It was helpful to see the cytogenetics of the marrow sample to help determine next treatments and she doesnt think additional work up with imaging is necessary. Dr. Billie Ruddy agrees that he needs multidrug therapy again and recommends carfilzomib/pomalidomide/dexamethasone since his disease previously progressed while on daratumumab. She recommends checking his M-spike with each cycle and if it continues to increase please let LTFU know. He would then be eligible for CARs.

His m-spike is stable, but I wanted to touch base as I know it can take awhile for Car-t planning.

IgG kappa multiple myeloma  2.  Stem cell transplant status    I met with the patient today to discuss treatment with CAR T cells. Specifically, the patient has relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and is a good candidate for BCMA CAR T cells (Abecma, Ide-cel), and has had > 4 lines of therapy, including PI, IMID and CD38 antibodies. We discussed the clinical trial data for Abecma; specifically, the Cox Medical Center Branson study (Munshi et al Alene Mires 2021), showed an ORR of 73%, and median PFS of 8.8 months, with MRD negativity in 26% of all patients. I also discussed the risks, including CRS and ICANS, both of which can be severe resulting in ICU stay, but treatable with IL6 antibodies and dexamethasone. I also reviewed additional toxicities, including cytopenias, infections, risk of secondary malignancy, and hypogammaglobulinemia. After a thorough discussion, the patient indicated interest in moving forward with CAR T therapy. I advised the patient that we will next contact the patient for insurance clearance and ROI, which will begin the process. I also explained that due to manufacturing constraints with Abecma it could be 6-9 months before the treatment can be administered.     I met with the patient today to discuss treatment with CAR T cells. Specifically, the patient has relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and is a good candidate for BCMA CAR T cells (Carvykti, Cilta-cel), and has had > 4 lines of therapy, including PI, IMID and CD38 antibodies. We discussed the clinical trial data for Carvykti;  specifically, the CARTITUDE-1 study Arbutus Ped et al Lancet 2021, Durward Mallard al Indian River Medical Center-Behavioral Health Center 2021), showed an ORR of 98%, stringent CR in 78% of patients, with MRD negativity in 92% of patients. At a median of 18 months follow up, median DOR was 21.8 months. I also discussed the risks, including CRS, ICANS, both of which can be severe resulting in ICU stay, but treatable with IL6 antibodies and dexamethasone. Additional risks associated with Carvykti includes Parkinsonism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, neuropathy, cranial nerve palsies, and HLH/MAS. I also reviewed additional toxicities, including prolonged/recurrent cytopenias, infections, risk of secondary malignancy, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Treatment related mortality is 9-10%. After a thorough discussion, the patient indicated interest in moving forward with CAR T (Carvykti) therapy. I advised the patient that we will next contact the patient for insurance clearance and ROI, which will begin the process. I also explained that due to manufacturing constraints with Carvykti it could be 6-9 months before the treatment can be administered.     - consider addition of daratumumab or isatuximab to the current regimen   - other potential standard of care options include selinexor with either bortezomib or carfilzomib (Xvd or XKD)   - bone marrow biopsy   - PET/CT   - pRBC transfusion today"

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY  Presented in 3/2019 with posterior bilateral rib pain (pain had been going on for 3 weeks and thought it was due to his labor intensive job), cough, fevers. CT chest on 3/23/2019 showed extensive metastatic disease in the spine and ribs along with a small right pleural effusion. CT abdomen pelvis on 3/23/2019 showed multiple lucent lesions throughout the visualized osseous structures including an expansile lesion in the anterior aspect of rib 5 on the left and a 3.3 cm lucent lesion of the left sacrum.  Myeloma markers on 3/24/2019 included an SPEP which showed an IgG kappa M spike at 6 g/dL, KFLC 65 mg/dL, LFLC 0.34 mg/dL, and K/L 190.88. He had a left rib core biopsy on 3/26/2019 which showed plasma cell neoplasm, kappa restricted, with patchy necrosis and neutrophilic infiltrate, negative for t(11;14).  During the initial hospitalization he  was found to have pneumonia.      He was first treated with CyBorD x 6 cycles from 3/2019 through 11/2019 and he had a VGPR.  Myeloma markers on 10/8/2019 had all improved: M spike 0.3 g/dL, KFLC 1.34 mg/dL, LFLC 0.92 mg/dL, K/L 1.46. The restaging bone marrow on 10/8/2019 showed <5% involvement of plasma cell neoplasm by pathology and flow showed an abnormal kappa restricted population (details not included on report). Cytogenetics and FISH were normal. He tolerated CyBorD fairly well aside from another episode of pneumonia in mid-August. With the CyBorD his  rib pain resolved (and remained so for 2 years). He was then put on maintenance treatment with Revlimid from 12/2019 through 4/2020 until he had progressive disease.  Myeloma markers on 4/15/2020 showed an increased M spike at 0.6 g/dL as well as increased light chains; KFLC 4.14 mg/dL, LFLC 1.24 mg/dL, K/L 3.34.     Next treated with RVD from 4/2020 through 6/2020, but had progressive disease by myeloma markers on 6/3/2020; M spike 0.9 g/dL, KFLC 5.00 mg/dL, LFLC 1.21 mg/dL, K/L 4.13.  So daratumumab was added and he was treated with Dara-RVD from 6/2020 through 4/2021.  From looking at his myeloma markers during dara-RVD it appears that they never really responded very well, and just continued to increase and by 3/17/2021 his M spike was 3.2 g/dL, LFLC 42.38 mg/dL, LFLC <0.14 mg/dL, K/L >302.71. Of note there were some issues with shipping and insurance for the Revlimid so some doses were missed, per patient, unsure how many. He also had a brief break in therapy in 10/2020 due to Cooke City infection.     Due to progressive disease he was switched back to CyBorD from 4/2021 through 7/2021. He initially had some response base on his myeloma markers, his M spike dropped down to 1.9 g/dL on 6/9/2021, along with improved light chains, KFLC 20.78 mg/dL, LFLC 0.24 mg/dL, K/L 86.58.  At around the same time, on a CT chest on 5/10/2021, obtained for chest pain, he was found to have new left axillary and retropectoral metastatic **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** adenopathy along with widespread osseous metastases with some new lesions compared to the scan on 3/30 2019.  Also had subacute fracture in the anterior right 10th rib also noted nondisplaced fractures associated with right sixth rib lesions.      From the notes it looks they did not immediately change treatment once they found the new lymphadenopathy and osseous lesions because his myeloma markers were improving. They also wanted to see if insurance would now cover an autologous stem cell transplant.   Unfortunately his myeloma markers began to increase, by 7/14/2021 his M spike was up to 2.3 g/dL, KFLC 28.19 mg/dL, LFLC 0.24 mg/dL, K/L 117.46.      To further evaluate disease he had a bone marrow MRI performed on 8/4/2021 that showed significantly progressive metastatic disease in the axial appendicular skeleton with innumerable new and enlarging lesions.  There was interval development of a large destructive lesion of the left temporal parietal skull as well as an extraosseous extension of the scalp and intracranial cavity, that measured 3.1 x 3.6 cm.  Near complete replacement of the vertebral body by lesion with focal extraosseous extension anteriorly.  Focal slight indentation/mass effect on the dorsal cord at T3-T4 level, similar to the prior exam.  Large metastatic lesions in the left femoral neck, bilateral sacral ala, and distal right femoral shaft that were at risk for a pathologic fracture.  Significant interval increase in the size of metastatic deposits in the proximal humeri, also risk for pathologic fracture.  Interval development of large lobular soft tissue mass along the anterior lateral left chest wall closely associated with the first through third ribs and extending into the left axilla with associated lymphadenopathy.  The primary mass measured 6.5 x 5.1 cm, with separate appearing left axillary lymph nodes/masses measuring in total 4.5 x 2.4 cm.    Given the findings on the bone marrow MRI a dedicated brain MRI was performed on 8/9/2021 that showed a 4.8 cm enhancing mass in the left frontoparietal portion of the bony calvarium, with both intracranial and extracranial components and with an area of skull destruction.  There was some mass effect on the brain, but no associated edema or midline shift.  There was additional scattered foci of enhancement in the diploic space of the bony calvarium of the skull that measure less than 1 cm in diameter.    On 8/11/2021 labs his M spike went up to  3.1 g/dL.    Was started on KPd from 8/2021 through 12/2021. He  also received XRT as follows: Left skull 3000 cGy in 10 fractions from 8/31/2021 9/14/2021, right shoulder 800 cGy in 1 fraction on 9/1/2021, left shoulder and axilla 800 cGy in 1 fraction on 9/2/2021, upper pelvis/bilateral hips 800 cGy in 1 fraction on 9/3/2021. Vision returned to normal with the Kpd and XRT.  Myeloma markers had improved, on 12/1/2021 M spike was 0.2 g/dL, KFLC 1.45 mg/dL, LFLC 0.73 mg/dL, K/L 1.99.    Next he arrived to Black River Ambulatory Surgery Center for an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant.  Mobilized with G-CSF and collected 11.4 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg over two days 1/11/2022 through 1/12/2022. He was conditioned with melphalan 200 mg/m and received a total of 5.7 x 10^6 CD34/kg on 1/21/2022 (he has an additional 5.7 x 10^6 CD34/kg cryopreserved.  Pretransplant bone marrow exam on 12/17/2021 was negative for disease by flow, pathology, and cytogenetics.  Pretransplant myeloma markers on 12/15/2021 showed M spike 0.1 g/dL, KFLC 1.72 mg/dL.  He also had a **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** lumbar puncture without intrathecal chemotherapy performed on 12/22/2021 that was negative for abnormal plasma cells.  Per the patient he did well and remained outpatient the whole time.  He had some regimen related toxicities including  diarrhea and nausea that was managed in the outpatient department with supportive care.    After transplant he went on maintenance with pomalidamide from 6/10/2022 throught 11/2022.  Myeloma markers on 6/29/2022 included M spike 0.7 g/dL, KFLC 8.36 mg/dL, LFLC 1.50 mg/dL, K/L 5.57.  They continue to steadily rise and by 11/2/2022 M spike was 2.0 g/dL, KFLC 34.88 mg/dL, LFLC 0.83 mg/dL, K/L 42.02.  Bone marrow biopsy performed on 8/19/2022 showed a small plasma cell population with equivocal light chain expression at 0.1% by flow and no increase in plasma cells by pathology.    His treatment was then switched back to KPd  from 11/2022 though 6/2023.   After the first cycle his M spike dropped to 1.5 g/dL on 11/29/2022 and he also noticed improvements in his light chains, KFLC 27.56 mg/dL, LFLC 0.76, K/L 36.26.  His myeloma markers continue to improve until they begin to rise again in 2/2023. Eventually his M spike was up to 2.2 g/dL on 6/13/2023, KFLC 201.45 mg/dL, <0.15 mg/dL, K/L >1,438.93.      Right around the beginning of the KPd treatment he developed double vision in his right eye.  A brain MRI on 11/8/2022 showed interval development of pathologic marrow signal in the clivus/central skull base, including both occipital condyles and the petrous apices, more prominent left than the right.  There was extraosseous extension were into the posterior nasopharyngeal soft tissues and extension into the cavernous sinuses, surrounding the cavernous ICAs are without any narrowing of either ICA demonstrated.  He received XRT to the clivus 3000 cGy for 10 fractions from 11/28/2022 through 12/8/2022.  After the radiation his double vision resolved.    He then saw Dr. Neil Crouch on 6/30/2023 for further treatment recommendations. Dr. Lianne Bushy recommended CAR-T therapy, but in the interim while waiting to get that scheduled she recommended various other treatments including PACE in order to keep a lid on his disease until he could arrive for CAR-T therapy.    Bone marrow exam on 7/18/2023 showed almost complete replacement by atypical kappa light chain restricted B cells by pathology and flow showed 3.1% abnormal plasma cells of the total white cells population.  Also showed an abnormal male karyotype, abnormal FISH results with 3-5 copies of 1q, t(4;14), and -13.     PET/CT performed on 7/26/2023 showed multifocal FDG avid medullary lesions throughout the axial appendicular skeleton including FDG uptake in the bilateral humeri, sternum, C7, spinous process of T3, vertebral body and left transverse process of T6 and L3 vertebral body, posterior left first rib and left third  rib, right second rib, right sixth rib with fracture, left 10th rib, bilateral femurs.  Multiple osseous lytic lesions with either no or mild FDG uptake found in the left parietal bone, left sacrum, left iliac and right superior pubic ramus.  Also noted FDG avid opacified paranasal sinuses, pulmonary opacities and bilateral large kidneys associated with increased cortical like which could have represented further sites of disease involvement.    Treated with PACE inpatient day 1 on 8/10/2023.  It was complicated by respiratory failure, pneumonia and AKI. Did not have to go to the ICU, did not require oxygen. Also had cytopenias requiring platelet and RBC transfusions.     Did well after PACE until he **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** developed posterior rib pain and right shin pain. XRT in 10/19/2023 to right rib 800 cGy in one fraction. Three days later rib pain resolved.  He also received XRT to T10-T12 spine 800 cGy in 1 fraction on and T1-T7 spine 800 cGy in 1 fraction on 10/19/2023. He also received XRT on 11/10/2023 to right pelvis and right tibia, unable to find dose of XRT in the notes. Did not have any pain to left lower shin until after XRT done on right tibia. Right shin pain improved with XRT.     Treated with doxorubicin, bortezomib, dexamethasone starting 11/13/2023. The shin pain has improved, but not resolved and continues to have pain in his right shin still along with less in the left shin. Last dose of dexamethasone, doxorubicin, bortezomib was on 11/16/2023.  Myeloma markers on 11/7/2023 were as follows KFLC 141.89 mg/dL, LFLC <0.15 mg/dL, K/L >1,013.50, no M spike available at the time. Last M spike was at 1.1 g/dL on 10/17/2023.     Using a walker for the past week to prevent falls due to the pain in his shins. Pain sometimes comes on suddenly. He is not having any weakness in his legs or lack of coordination. No falls or near falls per the patient, but his wife is worried he could fall. Not using the walker in the house,  mainly using it for long distances. Pain currently a 3 or 4 out of 10 in clinic today in his right shin, slightly less in the left shin. Walking doesn't make the pain worse and it comes and goes randomly. To manage the pain he uses Norco BID, changes positions, and applies Bengay to his shins. Sleeps through the night without pain. No fevers or chills within past few weeks. Eating well. No weight loss since recovering from PACE. Fatigue isn't a problem. No diarrhea or constipation.     He does have a cough, that started a month ago. Treated with oral antibiotics for 5 days. Didn't do a COVID test or chest xray. Overall improving. Coughing up a little yellow phlegm. No SOB. No runny nose, congestion, post-nasal drainage. Afebrile.

DISEASE:   # Relapsed refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma with high risk markers, gain 1q and t(4;14), and with extramedullary involvement including brain, s/p autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant on 1/21/2022   - Pre CAR T evaluation:   Whole-body PET/CT.  Bone marrow exam.  Brain MRI.  Diagnostic lumbar puncture, will discuss further with attending.  Myeloma  labs (SPEP and light chains).   UPEP and 24h urine.   - Leukapheresis:12/7/2023. Estimated cell return date 1/22/2024.  - Will need bridging therapy given aggressiveness of his disease. Has already received multiple therapies in the past, will need to discuss with Dr. Lianne Bushy further to see what she recommends. Planning on checking myeloma markers tomorrow.     HEME:   # Pancytopenic.  - HCT 25 today, ordered RBCs 1 unit for tomorrow. Repeating CBC tomorrow.   - ANC <0.49, gave GCSF today.   - Transfusion thresholds: HCT<26%, PLT<11k. PO Benadryl prior to platelets and RBCs. **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** ID:   # Cough. Ongoing for 1 month, s/p 5 day course of antibiotics weeks ago. Cough improved overall.   - Checking respiratory viral panel with COVID swab today.   - CXR ordered, patient left clinic before getting it done today so will do tomorrow.   - Droplet isolation.   - Given history of multiple  episodes of pneumonia in the past would recommend getting a dedicated chest CT to evaluate in more details.  # At risk for infection due to immunosuppression.   - Prophylaxis: Acyclovir, increased dose to standard dosing at 800 mg BID today. Stopping Bactrim given ongoing low counts and already completed more than 6 months of Bactrim post auto transplant. Starting levofloxacin today for ANC of 0.49.   # Zosyn allergy. Referring to allergy team for evaluation.     RRT:   # Disease related pain, only in shins R>L.   - Given neutropenia stopping hydrocodone-acetaminophen and switching to oxycodone so as not to mask a fever. Rx for oxycodone sent today.   - Counseled on not combining with other opioids and risks of oversedation.   # Deconditioned. Using a walker for the past week due to fear of falling or need to sit down due to shin pain when walking longer distances. No falls or near falls. No leg weakness. Referring to physical therapy for evaluation/recommendations.     OTHER:   # GERD. Continue pantoprazole.     # Hearing loss, TM perforation  of L TM from childhood infections and R TM abnormal appearing, but unable to visualize perforation on exam.  - Has seen audiologist in the past who made recommendations such as hearing aids or implants, but patient does not feel he needs any treatment.   - Able to communicate without issues in clinic today, gross auditory hearing intact.   - TMs do not appear infected on exam today.   - Due to the perforation he is at higher risk for middle ear infections.   - In the past when he gets sinus infections or URIs he has drainage come out of his ear which he receives topical antibiotics for (unclear if also receives PO antibiotics at the same time).     FEN:   # At risk for malnutrition, but adequate PO intake.   # Hypokalemia.  Continue PO Kcl.     DISPOSITION     This patient is stable and will keep their appointment tomorrow to meet with the Immunotherapy team attending, Dr. Elisabeth Pigeon, wherein we will place orders for pre-treatment work-up including disease, organ function, and infection assessments.  We will also schedule twice weekly labs and once weekly clinics between now and the time of the patient's data review."

Accompanying him today was his wife, their young daughter, a Spanish interpreter, and one of our Immunotherapy clinic team nurses.    Mr. Lucio Edward Diarte's oncologic history is recently summarized in the Immunotherapy Arrival History & Physical by Marisa Severin, PA-C dated 11/27/2023. In the interest of time, I did not review all of these details during our conference today. However, to briefly summarize: He was first diagnosed with IgG kappa myeloma in March 2019 after presenting with bilateral rib pain that he thought was related to his occupation.  He received CyBorD followed by lenalidomide maintenance until progression.  He then received RVD, but his disease progressed through this, so daratumumab was added.  When his disease progressed again, he was put back on CyBorD, which was then followed by carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (KPd) with palliative radiation to several sites of active disease.  This was followed by consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation following high-dose melphalan in June 2022.  He was given maintenance pomalidomide, but when there was concern for progression, he was put back on KPd, but this provided only transient response.  In August 2023, he was given PACE, which was complicated by pneumonia, respiratory failure, and AKI.  Instead of repeating this regimen, he was then given doxorubicin, bortezomib, and dexamethasone starting on 11/13/2023 with a goal of using this to ultimately facilitate arrival to our team for subsequent treatment with CAR T-cells.  I would again refer the interested reader to the Arrival H&P for additional details.    I began our conference by discussing the process of leukapheresis, with which  she is already familiar having undergone apheresis in order to collect his autologous stem cells.  I explained the need for a large bore central catheter to be placed to facilitate this procedure if his peripheral veins are inadequate.  I discussed the procedure itself and some of the potential risks associated with it, including but not limited to low blood pressure, cytopenias, hypocalcemia and associated complications, hypotension, and a temporary bleeding diathesis.  It typically takes several hours to perform, during which time they would be confined to our apheresis unit.  The yield from this procedure would then be transferred to a offsite cell manufacturing facility to hopefully then produce BCMA-targeted CAR-T cells following a process of viral transduction, culture, and quality assurance testing.  I discussed how this process typically has a very reliable yield, but problems can arise that could potentially prevent Korea from using this cell product for treatment.    During the cell production process, which can take 4 or more weeks, there would be a series of tests to assess organ function and confirm his candidacy for this therapy. I explained that we may also need to consider the role of bridging chemotherapy to try to keep the disease under control while awaiting production of the CAR-T cells.  We will decide on the details of this at a later date, but it would not be able to begin until after the leukapheresis procedure.  Given his extensive prior treatment and some of the more recent complications he developed, it may be difficult to identify an optimal bridging therapy.  However, we would plan to discuss this as a group and enlist the opinion of his primary oncologist here (Dr. Neil Crouch) **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** before settling on a plan, which would not be executed until after his cells are collected.    The next step will involve lymphodepleting chemotherapy in the form of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.  I explained that  this is typically done here in our clinic on 3 consecutive days.  I reviewed some of the potential side effects of this treatment, which are relatively similar to other multiagent chemotherapy regimens, including but no limited to fatigue, cytopenias and their inherent risks, alopecia, nausea, and the like.  Assuming that the cell product is acceptable, we would then plan for the cells to be reinfused after a period of rest following completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  As the cell product will be cryopreserved in the course of its manufacturing and transfer, I also talked about the potential risks associated with receiving DMSO.  I explained that the cell infusion will be done at our hospital to allow for inpatient monitoring for at least the first 10 days after cell infusion.    I then spent some time reviewing the risks that are unique to CAR-T cells.  The onset of the symptoms following infusion of ciltacabtagene autoleucel tends to occur within the first few days of its infusion, which is why a 10-day hospitalization is included as part of the treatment so that patients are already inpatient should these develop.  For patients who experience a relatively straight-forward or uncomplicated course, they can be discharged on Day 10.  However, we would only do this for those whose medical condition was stable enough for discharge; those with ongoing active issues that required hospitalization are kept in the hospital longer, if needed.  I discussed the different manifestations of cytokine release syndrome, ranging from mild symptoms like fever up to serious toxicities such as shock, multiorgan system failure, and death.  I also discussed the range of symptoms associated with neurologic toxicity, including but not limited to headache, tremor, stroke-like symptoms, seizure, brain swelling, coma, and death. In general, I said that these side effects are largely reversible, with two exceptions: death, and rare  cases of severe organ toxicity that lead to persistent deficits.  As a result of these potentially serious risks, we strongly recommend that all patients have formal healthcare directive documents on file and to have a discussion with their respective designated decision-makers about what they would want done in certain serious medical situations.      Following discharge from the hospital, there would be regular follow-up here at the Helotes Clinic to address any lingering toxicity.  We would then plan for restaging studies, typically in the form of blood work, imaging, and bone marrow exam, approximately 1 month after cell infusion.  Ideally at that time, these studies will demonstrate clear evidence of response.  If not, further discussions would be necessary to decide on appropriate next steps.  Therefore, we tell patients that they should anticipate needing to stay here in the Lehigh Wolf Trap Hospital Schuylkill area for approximately 1 month after CAR-T cell infusion.  Following this, it is reasonable to return home for local follow-up with their primary oncologist who referred them here.    I also talked a bit about some of the longer term risks associated with CAR-T cells.  I explained that sometimes, cytopenias can persist following this treatment.  This may require continued transfusion support and/or myeloid growth factor support.  Because of the potential for persistent neurologic toxicity, we counsel patients to not drive until 8 weeks after the cell infusion.  There are persistent **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** immunosuppressive side effects from this treatment, which typically require prophylactic antimicrobials.  Lastly, there are other late effects that could evolve with time that we have not yet been able to observe given the relatively short period of time that this therapeutic strategy has been available.  This would include complications associated with replication-competent lentivirus or insertional mutagenesis, 2 things that are theoretical  risks of this cellular therapy that fortunately have (to my knowledge) not yet been observed in the system.    Following this discussion, and ensuring that all of his questions were answered, we then turned our attention to the different documents that require review and signature.  We reviewed and signed where appropriate the clinical consents for apheresis, collection of immune effector cells, and the treatment with ciltacabtagene autoleucel, each of which I countersigned where appropriate (along with signatures from our Spanish interpreter where applicable).  We then turned our attention to different forms associated with ancillary research studies, which I explained were optional and could be pursued or declined without impacting the options for clinical care. We reviewed and he ultimately agreed to participate in HA1937902 (LTFU after IEC).  This entailed signatures from myself and the Spanish interpreter on the ICF, and signatures from the patient and the Pomaria interpreter on the Temple Terrace.  He also verbally agreed to HIPAA authorization for participation in IO9735329.    I spent a total of 90 minutes for the patient's care on the date of the service."

Our discussion was conducted with the help of a Spanish interpreter.    INTERIM HISTORY  Unfortunately despite bridging with isatuximab-carfilzomib-dexamethasone, Armend has developed worsening weakness in his legs and he is now wheelchair-bound. He met with Dr. Rutherford Nail yesterday and a spine MRI is planned. His laboratory studies from 1/9/23 suggest disease progression with increased total protein and mild hypercalcemia.    LABORATORY STUDIES  Per outside report 1/9/23:  WBC 2.8, Hb 8, platelet 25, ANC 1.3, ALC 0.7, creatinine 0.85, calcium 10.8, calcium 3.3, AST 24, ALT 24, total protein 9, albumin 3.3.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  Review of Systems   Constitutional:  Negative for fever.   Gastrointestinal:  Negative for constipation.   Genitourinary:  Negative for dysuria.   Musculoskeletal:  Positive for joint pain (Pain in left leg/foot (same from prior)).   Neurological:  Positive for focal weakness (Weakness in legs from ""knees down"") and weakness.      DISCUSSION    We discussed that his CAR-T cell product is out of specification. Specifically, the product did not meet the cell dose for release under the FDA label (0.1x10^6cells/kg, target dose 0.5-1.0x10^6/kg).   We discussed there is no data to date to support infusion of lower doses of Carvykti. I explained I was concerned the efficacy (ie, anti-myeloma effects) would be reduced using a significantly lower CAR T-cell dose.  Consequently, I explained we recommended to re-apherese (scheduled 1/18). The estimated product delivery date would be 3/1.  In the meanwhile, I explain that I would recommend bridging therapy with talquetamab after his second leukapheresis. We discussed they should expect to stay in South Carolina for a prolonged period of time  through the end of March early April.    Anti-Cancer Therapy Consent    I/we spoke with the patient about the proposed treatment regimen:  Talquetamab  The purpose of this treatment is:  Disease control - the goal is to improve quality of life and/or length of life, not to cure the cancer  Other options for treatment and their risks and benefits were discussed, including no treatment.  Potential side effects of therapy were discussed. These include, but are not limited to: Fatigue, Risk of Infection and Infusion Reaction, Change in Taste Sensation, Diarrhea, Nausea/Vomiting and Anorexia, Neutropenia, Low Red Blood Cell Count/Anemia and Low Platelets and Risk of Bleeding, Other, cytokine release syndrome, flu-like symptoms  The patient (and his wife), through an interpreter, had the opportunity to ask questions and expressed understanding of the proposed treatment and agrees to proceed.  He will also receive written materials on the regimen schedule and toxicity and, if applicable, a chemotherapy teaching session with a nurse or pharmacist.     I will also request our Social Workers to reach out to the patient to discuss support for housing and transportation (specifically since he is now requiring a wheelchair).  My team will reach out to discuss any changes to his schedule.    TIME STATEMENT  I spent a total of 60 minutes for the patient's care on the date of service.      This visit is being conducted over the telephone at the patient's request: No (issue with Zoom)  Patient gives verbal consent to proceed and knows there may be a copay/deductible: Yes **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** Time spent with patient/guardian on this telephone visit: 40 minutes      Sincerely,    Martinique Dutchess Crosland, MD, MSc  Associate Professor  Reston Surgery Center LP, Westland of California, Gatlinburg of Medical Oncology  O 908-667-6162  C 929-311-6116  P (386)735-3954  Jgauthier@fredhutch .Radonna Ricker"

Prior transfusion history:   Per report, the most recent dose of  Isatuximab  monoclonal antibody therapy occurred on 01/03/2024.    CURRENT TRANSFUSION WORKUP   A sample was received at the Shriners' Hospital For Children-Greenville transfusion services lab Va Eastern Kansas Healthcare System - Leavenworth) which demonstrated a blood type of A positive, with a broadly reactive positive antibody screen, and a pan-reactive antibody identification panel. After removing the anti-CD38 interference with dithiothreitol (DTT), no antibodies were identified.     The patient's red cell phenotype is negative for the K antigen.      INTERPRETATION    The patient is on a monoclonal anti-CD38 antibody indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. However, red blood cells also possess CD38 antigen. Thus, all cells in an antibody panel, including the auto-control, will appear positive, simulating a warm autoantibody. To account for this, the reagent cells were treated with DTT to remove the CD38 antigen, and another antibody panel was performed as above. However, DTT also removes antigens from the Kell blood group system so an anti-K cannot be definitively ruled out. Other blood groups that are less common causes of hemolytic reactions are Kell, Lutheran, YT, JMH, LW, Cromer, Panama, Naranjito, and Knops systems can also be denatured or modified by DTT treatment.     RECOMMENDATIONS    -For routine red blood cell transfusion needs this patient will receive  ABO compatible K antigen negative red blood cells. Please note the serologic crossmatch performed for units for this patient might appear incompatible due to the presence of the monoclonal antibody therapy.  -The additional work-up prior requires an additional hour for the testing/preparation of units.     The case was discussed with Dr. Awanda Mink, Transfusion Medicine Attending. The patient was not seen.     Please do not hesitate to contact the Pacaya Bay Surgery Center LLC Transfusion Medicine Service with any questions at 984 377 0931.

Decreased ROM in hips, spine, 2/2 mm lesions and/or pain.  Treatment and cancer-related fatigue, low.  Balance impairment and is a high fall risk as per fall screen and pain with ambulation, deconditioning, decreased insight into safety and fracture risk reduction.  Postural abnormalities including forward flexed,  rounded spine in gait, increased t-spine kyphosis in seated - able to correct intermittently in quiet standing posture, but non sustained functionally.  Patient is at high risk of deconditioning during stem cell transplantation treatment and recovery.    Limited physical evaluation again today, >1 month since last PT assessment due to unclear pathologic fx risk of bilateral lower extremities. Particularly LLE Femur/pelvis as this has not been directly imaged since previous physical therapy appointment where concern for impending femoral fx was raised (Tibia/fibula Xray and osseous survey did not adequately assess femur/pelvis). Pt has ongoing shin pain which may be referral pattern from hip joint/SI joint. Pain radiates into hip/groin/femur 8/10 that requires seated rest within just 10 seconds of standing stepping in place. Pt has been mobilizing via wheelchair for many weeks now (was using 4WW at last PT evaluation - this represents a SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN FUNCTION) and does not walk more than a few steps at a time due to pain and instability. Discussed concerns with Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center team PA today - anticipating detailed imaging of femurs and pelvis - require confirmation of no impending femoral fracture in order to recommend ambulation or progress open or closed chain LE exercises at this time.     Pt also sent back to 6th floor immunotherapy after visit due to presence of possible rash on his torso following receiving blood product today.    Recommend pt continue mobilizing via Leisure World and with wife's help until fx risk can be ruled out.      Pt would benefit from skilled physical therapy to address physical impairments and functional limitations noted above      PLAN:    Recommend patient to return for care 1-2x per week for 8 weeks and then reassess for ongoing needs.  For list of possible treatment types/modalities that may be used for this pt, please see bottom of note.     Plan for Next Visit:  lefs  Imaging for fx risk  L femur????

History of Present Illness:  Mr. Lucio Edward Diarte's oncologic history is well described in previous documentations. For more details, please refer to the IMTX Outpatient History and Physical done by Marisa Severin, PA-C on 11/27/2023 and the Arrival Conference by Dr. Elisabeth Pigeon on 11/28/2023.    Briefly, Pinchus arrived to the immunotherapy team at then end of November for BCMA directed CAR-T cell therapy with Carvykti. Initial collection performed on 12/7/23 but unfortunately cells were out of spec due to low cell count, requiring recollection. Treated with bridging chemotherapy with Isatuximab/Carfizomib/Dexamethasone (last dose 1/3) with no response. Recollected on 1/23/24 and now is being admitted for bridging therapy with dose escalating Talquetamab.    Klaus has been having worsening pain of the left tibia that radiates up to his lower back since the end of December. It is worse with standing, greatly affecting his mobility. He now requires help always when mobilizing and can't go far due to the pain. Pain 3/10 in L leg when lying in bed and doesn't hurt in the R leg. He says that occasionally it feels like it makes him ""weaker"", but there is no motor deficit on exam and strength is equal in bilateral lower extremities. Prior to end of December he was walking with a walker for stability. He denies any fevers, chills, headaches, nasal congestion, frontal or maxillary sinus pain, sore throat or cough. He and his wife are staying locally while he gets his treatment. They have had no recent sick contacts. Denies nausea and vomiting. Says he still has a good appetite and is able to eat full meals. No change in bowel or bladder habits. No numbness  or tingling of the lower extremities or the saddle region of his inner thighs.    Review of Systems:  A complete review of systems was conducted and was negative in detail except as described in HPI above.    Multiple Myeloma History:  Diagnosis and prior treatment:  - Diagnosed in March 2019, presenting with posterior bilateral rib pain, and found to have extensive metastatic disease in the spine and ribs.  - Treated with CyBorD x 6 cycles (3/2019-11/2019) with VGPR. Placed on maintenance treatment with Revlimid (12/2019-4/2020) until he had progressive disease.  - Treated with RVD (4/2020-6/2020) he again had progressive disease so daratumumab was added. Treated with Dara RVD (6/2020-4/2021).  - Due to progressive disease back to CyBorD (4/2021-6/2021)  - Continued to progress so put on Kpd (8/2021-12/2021) + palliative radiation.  - Consolidation with autologous PBSCT conditioned with melphalan 200 mg/msq June 2022, followed by maintenance pomalidamide (6/2022-11/2022).  - With increase in myeloma markers switched back to Kpd (11/2022-6/2023)  - Continued progression led to inpatient treatment with PACE (8/2023), which was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring O2 but not ICU), pneumonia and AKI.  - Chose not to repeat PACE give course complications and instead gave doxorubicine, bortezomib, and dexamethatsone starting 11/2023 with goal of facilitating arrival to Kindred Hospital - San Antonio Central team for CAR-T cell therapy.

Large ventral epidural soft tissue tumor extending from L2 through L4, Bilsky grade 3. Resulting severe central stenosis at L3-4 with complete effacement of the thecal sac and clumping of the cauda equina nerve roots likely reflecting a component of arachnoiditis. Tumor also extends into the L3-4 and L4-5 neural foramina contributing to moderate to severe foraminal stenoses.   Bilsky grade 1B ventral epidural soft tissue tumors at L1 and L2.   Additional focal lesions in the partially seen T11 and T12 vertebral bodies.   Pathologic fractures T12-L2, and probably in T11, not present on PET July 26, 2023, with mild anterior height loss.     MRI Pelvis (1/24/24)  Diffuse abnormal marrow signal is most consistent with documented history of multiple myeloma, with marrow replacing lesion in the left sacral ala extending into the left S1 neural foramen and contacting the exiting nerve root.     Assessment and Plan:  Mr. Brentin Shin Izyk Marty is a 50 year old male with relapsed refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma who is pre-BCMA directed CAR-T cells with Carvykti, admitted for bridging therapy with Talquetamab ramp-up.     Oncology:  - For complete disease and treatment history please see prior notes and H&P.   - 1st leukopheresis 12/7, but out of spec due to low cell count requiring re-collection.  Bridging chemotherapy with isatuximab/Carfizomib/Dexamethasone (last dose 1/3)  - Recollected 1/23/2024  - MM markers (1/24): KFLC 204, LFLC < 0.15, ratio >1456.71, M spike 2.6 IgG kappa, Kappa free light chain TSTQ.  - Concern for progressive disease with worsening bone pain of the left fibula that radiates to the lower back. Outpatient workup showed no signs of fracture.  MRI L spine + pelvis done (1/24): showing progressive disease with concern for spinal stability. **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** Rad Onc consulted: Previous tumors have been very responsive to radiation, some requiring as few as 1 dose. Requesting outside records of previous radiation treatment to help try and plan current treatment plan.  Neuro surg consulted: Requested spine CT.

He was found to have a large ventral epidural soft tissue mass from L2-4, Bilsky grade 3, identified on MRI as part of work up of progressive left lower extremity pain. We are consulted for recommendations on management.          SUBJECTIVE   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. Albertine Patricia history was reviewed in prior notes outlined in IMTX Outpatient History and Physical done by Marisa Severin, PA-C on 11/27/2023 and the Arrival Conference by Dr. Elisabeth Pigeon on 11/28/2023. Briefly summarized below.    Briefly, Yancarlos arrived to the immunotherapy team at then end of November for BCMA directed CAR-T cell therapy with Carvykti. Initial collection performed on 12/7/23 but unfortunately cells were out of spec due to low cell count, requiring recollection. Treated with bridging chemotherapy with Isatuximab/Carfizomib/Dexamethasone (last dose 1/3) with no response. Recollected on 1/23/24 and now is being admitted for bridging therapy with dose escalating Talquetamab.     In Nov 2023, he developed new pain in the left lower extremity that persisted into Dec 2023 to the point that ambulation become difficult due to pain. He is able to walk, but would require assistance for stability with either a walker or by 1 person assist. He continued to have intermittent pain that worsened with lying flat, so would sit up right given this was  the most comfortable position. He denied numbness or tingling in the bilateral lower extremities. He has continued to have regular bowel movements and has not had episodes of urinary or bowel incontinence. He denies saddle anesthesia. He was taking Morphine ER 15 mg and oxycodone scheduled q4 hrs over the last several days with some relief, though the pain did not fully disappear.   He received first dose of Talquetamab 1/25.  Today he reports minimal pain with lying down and has noticed maybe even a bit of improvement in pain since the start of hospitalization. He is currently prescribed ER morphine 30 mg BID and oxycodone PRN, which has helped somewhat as well.   Since admission, in addition to left lower extremity pain he has noticed right lower extremity sense of ""heaviness"" as well as swelling to the mid shin. This is new and developed after non-tunneled line placement. He continues to deny pain in the right lower ext.  He also denies headaches, nausea, vision changes/blurry vision, changes in strength in upper extremities.   An MRI was obtained 1/24/24 as part of work up of lower extremity pain. This revealed a large ventral epidural soft tissue tumor extending from L2 through L4, Bilsky grade 3, with resulting severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and complete effacement of the thecal sac. There is also Bilsky grade 1b ventral epidural soft tissue tumors at L1-2. Pathologic fractures are present at T12-L2 and probably at T11.

SUBJECTIVE   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. Albertine Patricia history was reviewed in prior notes outlined in IMTX Outpatient History and Physical done by Marisa Severin, PA-C on 11/27/2023 and the Arrival Conference by Dr. Elisabeth Pigeon on 11/28/2023. Briefly summarized below.    Briefly, Yancarlos arrived to the immunotherapy team at then end of November for BCMA directed CAR-T cell therapy with Carvykti. Initial collection performed on 12/7/23 but unfortunately cells were out of spec due to low cell count, requiring recollection. Treated with bridging chemotherapy with Isatuximab/Carfizomib/Dexamethasone (last dose 1/3) with no response. Recollected on 1/23/24 and now is being admitted for bridging therapy with dose escalating Talquetamab.     In Nov 2023, he developed new pain in the left lower extremity that persisted into Dec 2023 to the point that ambulation become difficult due to pain. He is able to walk, but would require assistance for stability with either a walker or by 1 person assist. He continued to have intermittent pain that worsened with lying flat, so would sit up right given this was  the most comfortable position. He denied numbness or tingling in the bilateral lower extremities. He has continued to have regular bowel movements and has not had episodes of urinary or bowel incontinence. He denies saddle anesthesia. He was taking Morphine ER 15 mg and oxycodone scheduled q4 hrs over the last several days with some relief, though the pain did not fully disappear.   He received first dose of Talquetamab 1/25.  Today he reports minimal pain with lying down and has noticed maybe even a bit of improvement in pain since the start of hospitalization. He is currently prescribed ER morphine 30 mg BID and oxycodone PRN, which has helped somewhat as well.   Since admission, in addition to left lower extremity pain he has noticed right lower extremity sense of ""heaviness"" as well as swelling to the mid shin. This is new and developed after non-tunneled line placement. He continues to deny pain in the right lower ext.  He also denies headaches, nausea, vision changes/blurry vision, changes in strength in upper extremities.   An MRI was obtained 1/24/24 as part of work up of lower extremity pain. This revealed a large ventral epidural soft tissue tumor extending from L2 through L4, Bilsky grade 3, with resulting severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and complete effacement of the thecal sac.

Date of Service: 1/27/2024    SUBJECTIVE & HISTORY     Reason for Consult:  Complex pain management issues: opioid tolerance, history of chronic pain, inadequate response to conventional treatment, specialized expertise in medication use.    Reason for Admission:  The patient is 87 year old male with relapsed refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma who is pre-BCMA directed CAR-T cells with Carvykti, admitted on 1/24/24 for bridging therapy with Talquetamab ramp-up.     Chronic pain service consulted for worsening cancer related pain since last night.     Presenting Pain Complaint:  Interview is though Frederic interpreter. Patient and his wife provided history.  The patient's main pain complaint today is primarily located in the anterior-medial left tibia radiating to lateral thigh to left hip; he also has intermittent pain at right anterior tibia. This pain started in Nov 2023 and became worse in December. He has been have difficulty ambulating due to LLE pain, even with walker. The pain is described as continuous (LLE) and intermittent (RLE); characterized as squeezing. Aggravating factors include walking or prolonged standing. Relieving factors include steroid, oral and IV opioids. Patient feels the most effect treatment is the steroid this morning (Dex).  Highest pain intensity score in the last 24 hours is 10/10 (last night) and lowest is 0/10.  The patient's pain complaint is adequately controlled at this time and is satisfied with pain control.     Patient's pain has been well managed with his home pain regimen of MS ER 69m bid  and Oxycodone 590m2-3 a day before and after admission, but he had significant pain flare of his LLE pain since last night, for unclear reason other than he may have walked more yesterday.

OBJECTIVE     Imaging & Testing:  I reviewed the patient's most recent imaging and other testing and noted:   XR L SPINE 2-3 VW  1/26/24  Normal alignment of the lumbar spine with a kyphosis angle of 26 degrees at the thoracolumbar junction. Mild anterior wedging of T12 and L1 vertebrae with additional endplate changes involving T11 and T12 vertebrae similar to the prior cross-sectional imaging studies. Moderate spondylitic findings in the lower lumbar spine. Of note, widespread infiltrative marrow changes as well as the epidural extension seen to better advantage on the cross-sectional studies especially the MRI **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** study.    CT Full Spine 1/25/24  Pathologic compression fractures of T12, L1 and L2. Pathologic fracture of the right L3 transverse process.  Large soft tissue mass in the L2 and L4 epidural space and extending into the right L3-4 neural foramen  Soft tissue mass involving left sacral ala with erosion through the cortex of the sacrum into the SI joint. Additional erosion into the anterior cortex of the left sacral ala at the S2 level. Possible involvement of the left S2 neural foramen.     MRI Brain 1/26/24  Interval progression of disease as evidenced by multiple new or enlarging innumerable enhancing lesions throughout the calvarium.   New right frontal dural lesion abuts the underlying brain parenchyma with mild mass effect on the brain parenchyma.   New lesion of the left orbital roof which at least abuts the superior rectus.     MRI L spine 1/24/24  Diffusely heterogeneous marrow signal consistent with given history of multiple myeloma. Large ventral epidural soft tissue tumor extending from L2 through L4, Bilsky grade 3. Resulting severe central stenosis at L3-4 with complete effacement of the thecal sac and clumping of the cauda equina nerve roots likely reflecting a component of arachnoiditis. Tumor also extends into the L3-4 and L4-5 neural foramina contributing to moderate to severe foraminal stenoses.   Bilsky grade 1B ventral epidural soft tissue tumors at L1 and L2.   Additional focal lesions in the partially seen T11  and T12 vertebral bodies.   Pathologic fractures T12-L2, and probably in T11, not present on PET July 26, 2023, with mild anterior height loss.      MRI Pelvis 1/24/24  Diffuse abnormal marrow signal is most consistent with documented history of multiple myeloma, with marrow replacing lesion in the left sacral ala extending into the left S1 neural foramen and contacting the exiting nerve root.     XR KNEE and Tibia Fibula 1-2 VW LEFT 1/22/24  No bone, joint, or soft tissue abnormality is seen. There are no fractures or dislocations.    XR FEMUR 2 VW LEFT 1/19/24  There is mild left hip osteoarthritis with ossicle adjacent to the lateral acetabular rim. 1.0 cm enostosis at the medial femoral head. No fracture or dislocation. No lytic lesion.    XR TIBIA FIBULA 2 VW BILAT 12/7/23  Right: No significant osseous or soft tissue abnormalities are noted. No acute fractures or dislocations noted. No lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.   Left: No significant osseous or soft tissue abnormalities are noted. No acute fractures or dislocations noted. No lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.   However, if the patient continues to have clinically significant pain, MR may be helpful in demonstrating an occult lesion, such as a stress fracture.    XR OSSEOUS SURVEY COMPLETE 12/6/23  1.  Multiple lytic lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, as above, in keeping with multiple myeloma.  2.  Several chronic thoracolumbar compression fractures with minimal loss of height.  3.  Note that the legs are not typically included in the osseous survey series. Consider dedicated leg radiographs in area of clinical concern if clinically warranted.    Skull: Multiple calvarial lytic lesions.  Cervical spine: Multiple small lytic lesions, better seen on prior PET/CT. No fracture.  Thoracic spine: Multiple lytic lesions, better seen on prior PET/CT. Chronic T6, T7, T9, and T12 superior endplate compression fractures with minimal  loss of height.  Lumbar spine: Multiple small lytic lesions, better seen **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** on prior PET/CT. Chronic L1 superior endplate compression fracture with minimal loss of height.  Pelvis: Multiple pelvic and sacral lytic lesions.  Femora: Small lytic lesions in the left proximal femur.  Humeri: Bilateral proximal humeral lucencies, also seen on prior PET/CT.

Chronic pain service consulted for worsening cancer related pain since last night.    Patient has progressive disease involving diffusely his axial and appendicular skeleton including spine, skull and dural. Recent images revealed pathologic compression fracture in T12, L1, L2 and right L3 transverse process, probably T11. There are large soft tissue mass in the L2 and L4 epidural space and  extending into the right L3-4 neural foramen, also soft tissue mass involving left sacral ala with erosion through the cortex of the sacrum into the SI joint. Additional **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** erosion into the anterior cortex of the left sacral ala at the S2 level. Possible involvement of the left S2 neural foramen.      The patient's main pain complaint today is primarily located in the anterior-medial left tibia radiating to lateral thigh to left hip and intermittent pain at right anterior tibia. This pain started in Nov 2023 and became worse in December. This pain is interfering his ambulation ability. His pain is most likely related to his multiple myeloma progression, though the xray of his femur, tibia/fibula and knees did not show malignant bony lesions. Of note, he had XRT to right pelvis/tibia in Nov 2023 with good pain relief. At this time, patient denied back pain.    Patient's pain has been well managed with his home pain regimen of MS ER 67m bid and Oxycodone 558m2-3 a day before and after admission, but he had significant pain flare of his LLE pain last night, for unclear reason other than he may have been more active. His pain has much improved this morning, in fact he reports no pain in the last few hours and at time of this visit. He has only used very small dose of HM PCA, 46m53mn the last 5 hrs. Patient attributed the relief to Dex IV this morning, as steroid has helped his pain in the past. The relief may also be the result of high dose IV Morphine and IV HM he received last night and early this morning (total 2.5mg41m IV HM and 6mg 70mIV Morphine). Patient is tolerating current pain regimen without safety concerns.     Neurosurgery consulted on 1/25 for his spinal lesions. Recommended Radiation therapy and no immediate neurosurgical intervention needed at this time.  RadOnc was also consulted on 1/25 with plan for SIM oSurgery Center Of Californiaonday 1/29. Of note, patient has received several prior courses of radiotherapy, most recently to  the T1-7 and T10-12 spine in Oct 2023, right pelvis/tibia in Nov 2023. He reports doing well with prior radiation with few side effects.     Issues Needing Clarification: none  Pain control/progress: there is evidence of adequate pain control. The patient is making satisfactory progress.  Functional Pain Assessment: the patient meets functional requirements for pain management and hesitates activities because of pain.  Complexity: there is significant patient complexity issues requiring a high level of pain assessment and management.    Management:  Patient's pain is well controlled at this time; in fact reported no pain at this time. Current pain regimen is well tolerated without safety concerns.     It is not clear the etiology of acute pain flare last night and recommend continues to closely monitor.    Following recommendations discussed with primary team:  May resume MS ER 30mg 946mwhich has helped his cancer related pain and is well tolerated.    May continue current low dose MS PCA tonight, in case of recurrent acute pain flare. May titrate up PCA dose if needed and without safety concerns.   May resume Oxycodone 5-10mg q71mrn and discontinue PCA if his pain remains well controlled and minimal use of IV MS.     Would avoid benzodiazepine when on PCA if possible.     May change diphenhydramine IV push to IVPB if possible, to avoid oversedation when on PCA, however, defer to primary team's discretion.     We discussed pain management options including potential limitations of the pain management plan and side effects related to medication use. **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** Primary team to continue management at this time. The chronic pain service will sign off at this time. Please reach out to chronic pain service for further questions or concerns.    I spent a total of 90 minutes for the patient's care on the date of the service."

He is pre-BCMA directed CAR-T cells with Carvykti and was admitted for bridging therapy with Talquetamab ramp-up. He was found to have a large ventral epidural soft tissue mass from L2-4 on MRI as part of work up of progressive left lower extremity pain.      A Spanish interpreter was present during the consultation.    SUBJECTIVE   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. Phillips Climes is a 55 year old male who was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2019. He was treated with CyBorD x 6 cycles (3/2019-11/2019) with VGPR and was placed on maintenance treatment with Revlimid (12/2019-4/2020) until he had progressive disease. He was then treated with RVD (4/2020-6/2020) but he then had progressive disease, so daratumumab was added. He was then treated with Dara RVD (6/2020-4/2021). As a result of progressive disease, he received CyBorD (4/2021-6/2021). He continued  to progress, so he was put on Kpd (8/2021-12/2021) and palliative radiotherapy was given. He underwent consolidation with autologous PBSCT conditioned with melphalan 200 mg/msq in June 2022, followed by maintenance pomalidamide (6/2022-11/2022). He then had an increase in myeloma markers and his treatment was switched back to Kpd (11/2022-6/2023). He continued to have progression leading to inpatient treatment with PACE (8/4696), but was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring O2), pneumonia and AKI. He then received doxorubicin, bortezomib, and dexamethatsone starting 11/2023 with goal of facilitating arrival to Golden Gate Endoscopy Center LLC team for CAR-T cell therapy. In  11/ 2023, he developed new pain in the left lower extremity that persisted into 12/ 2023. His ambulation became difficult due to pain. He was still able to walk, but would require assistance for stability with either a walker or by 1 person assist. He continued to have intermittent pain that was worsened with lying flat. He had no numbness or tingling in the bilateral lower extremities. He had regular bowel movements and had no urinary or bowel incontinence. He had no saddle anesthesia. He was taking Morphine ER 15 mg and oxycodone scheduled q4 hrs for pain control with some relief. He received his first dose of Talquetamab 1/25/2024. Since admission, on top of left lower extremity pain, he has noticed right lower extremity clumsiness and swelling to the mid shin. MRI was obtained on 1/24/24 as part of work up of lower extremity pain showing a large ventral epidural soft tissue tumor extending from L2 through L4, Bilsky grade 3, with resulting severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and complete effacement of the thecal sac. There is also Bilsky grade 1b ventral epidural soft tissue tumors at L1-2. Pathologic fractures are present at T12-L2 and probably at T11.

He then received doxorubicin, bortezomib, and dexamethatsone starting 11/2023 with goal of facilitating arrival to Golden Gate Endoscopy Center LLC team for CAR-T cell therapy. In  11/ 2023, he developed new pain in the left lower extremity that persisted into 12/ 2023. His ambulation became difficult due to pain. He was still able to walk, but would require assistance for stability with either a walker or by 1 person assist. He continued to have intermittent pain that was worsened with lying flat. He had no numbness or tingling in the bilateral lower extremities. He had regular bowel movements and had no urinary or bowel incontinence. He had no saddle anesthesia. He was taking Morphine ER 15 mg and oxycodone scheduled q4 hrs for pain control with some relief. He received his first dose of Talquetamab 1/25/2024. Since admission, on top of left lower extremity pain, he has noticed right lower extremity clumsiness and swelling to the mid shin.

He was treated with CyBorD x 6 cycles (3/2019-11/2019) with VGPR and was placed on maintenance treatment with Revlimid (12/2019-4/2020) until he had progressive disease. He was then treated with RVD (4/2020-6/2020) but he then had progressive disease, so daratumumab was added. He was then treated with Dara RVD (6/2020-4/2021). As a result of progressive disease, he received CyBorD (4/2021-6/2021). He continued  to progress, so he was put on Kpd (8/2021-12/2021) and palliative radiotherapy was given. He underwent consolidation with autologous PBSCT conditioned with melphalan 200 mg/msq in June 2022, followed by maintenance pomalidamide (6/2022-11/2022).

Dermatology is consulted for a rash with request for recommendations regarding differential diagnosis and treatment.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient and his wife report that on 2/1 he developed a rash around the ears and neck that spread yesterday to involve the upper chest and left shoulder, then today to the extremities including the palms and soles. Patient's wife reports that some areas of rash have faded since they first appeared, particularly the palms which appear less red today than yesterday. The rash is asymptomatic and he otherwise feels generally well. Denies oral/eye/GU mucosal pain/sores. Denies dry mouth, dysgeusia. Denies history of similar rashes in the past. The primary team prescribed triamcinolone 0.1% cream yesterday, which was applied last night and this morning; patient and his wife are unclear if this has made much of a difference in his rash.    He was intermittently spiking non-neutropenic fevers from 1/31-2/1 and has been afebrile since then. Fevers are thought likely related to CRS/inflammatory response from talquetamab per oncology; there is a lower concern for an occult infectious process at this time. Blood cultures from 1/31 and 2/2 are NGTD. His only antimicrobial prophylactic medication currently is valacyclovir.    He received talquetamab 1/24 (first dose), 1/27, and 1/30 and reportedly tolerated the infusions well. His next dose is planned for 2/7 then will be continued q7 days.    Other relevant medication history:  - Allopurinol started 1/24 for TLS prophylaxis, per Oncology  - Last round of chemotherapy ended 1/3 (isatuximab/carfizomib/dexamethasone)      MEDICATIONS:  Current  Outpatient Medications   Medication Instructions    allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) 300 mg, Oral, Daily    loperamide 2 MG capsule Take 1 capsule (2 mg) by mouth every 6 hours as needed for diarrhea. Take after each loose stool. Do not take more than 8 capsules (16 mg) a day.    magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) 400 mg, Oral, 2 times daily with meals    morphine ER (MS CONTIN) 30 mg, Oral, 2 times daily    naloxone (Narcan) 4 MG/0.1ML nasal spray Use 1 spray in one nostril for suspected opioid overdose. Call 911. If unresponsive in 2 to 3 minutes, repeat with new naloxone nasal spray.    oxyCODONE 5 MG tablet Take 1-2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for severe pain.    pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg, Oral, Daily    potassium chloride ER 10 MEQ ER tablet 40 mEq, Oral, Daily    prochlorperazine (COMPAZINE) 10 mg, Oral, Every 6 hours PRN    senna (SENOKOT) 17.2 mg, Oral, Daily PRN    valACYclovir 500 MG tablet Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times a day.       PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  General: Well-appearing, NAD  A full skin examination was performed sparing the buttocks/genitalia and was remarkable for the following:    - Faint blanching ill-defined pink patches without overlying surface change symmetrically distributed on the anterior neck, upper chest, upper extremities (predominantly medial/flexural), and proximal thighs; petechial patches on the popliteal fossae  - Increased erythema on the soles>palms; soles with background xerosis  - No facial edema   - No oral mucosal involvement  - No **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** scleral injection  - Nails are unremarkable  - No cervical/axillary LAD    LABS:   Latest Reference Range & Units Most Recent   WBC 4.3 - 10.0 10*3/uL 1.08 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   RBC 4.40 - 5.60 10*6/uL 3.23 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   Hemoglobin 13.0 - 18.0 g/dL 9.8 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   Hematocrit 38.0 - 50.0 % 28 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   MCV 81 - 98 fL 86  2/2/24 22:40   MCH 27.3 - 33.6 pg 30.3  2/2/24 22:40   MCHC 32.2 - 36.5 g/dL 35.4  2/2/24 22:40   Platelet  Count 150 - 400 10*3/uL 22 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   RDW-CV 11.0 - 14.5 % 17.1 (H)  2/2/24 22:40   (L): Data is abnormally low  (H): Data is abnormally high   Latest Reference Range & Units Most Recent   % Neutrophils % 91  2/2/24 22:40   % Lymphocytes % 6  2/2/24 22:40   % Monocytes % 3  2/2/24 22:40   % Eosinophils % 0  2/2/24 22:40   % Basophils % 0  2/2/24 22:40   % Immature Granulocytes % 0  2/2/24 22:40   % Nucleated RBC % 0  2/2/24 22:40   Neutrophils 1.80 - 7.00 10*3/uL 0.98 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   Absolute Neutrophil Comment  Comment not required  2/4/22 07:07   Absolute Lymphocyte Count 1.00 - 4.80 10*3/uL 0.06 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   Monocytes 0.00 - 0.80 10*3/uL 0.03  2/2/24 22:40   Absolute Eosinophil Count 0.00 - 0.50 10*3/uL 0.00  2/2/24 22:40   Basophils 0.00 - 0.20 10*3/uL 0.00  2/2/24 22:40   Immature Granulocytes 0.00 - 0.05 10*3/uL 0.00  2/2/24 22:40   Nucleated RBC 0.00 10*3/uL 0.00  2/2/24 22:40   Total Cells Counted  77  1/30/22 11:15   (L): Data is abnormally low     Latest Reference Range & Units Most Recent   AST (GOT) 9 - 38 U/L 31  2/2/24 22:40   ALT (GPT) 10 - 64 U/L 16  2/2/24 22:40   Alkaline Phosphatase (Total) 39 - 139 U/L 57  2/2/24 22:40   Gamma Glutamyl Transferase 0 - 55 U/L 21  12/15/21 11:39   Bilirubin (Total) 0.2 - 1.3 mg/dL 0.4  2/2/24 22:40   Bilirubin (Direct) 0.0 - 0.3 mg/dL 0.0  2/2/24 22:40   Protein (Total) 6.0 - 8.2 g/dL 7.3  2/2/24 22:40   Albumin 3.5 - 5.2 g/dL 3.1 (L)  2/2/24 22:40   (L): Data is abnormally low    Micro:  Blood cultures NGTD (2/2, 1/31)  Urine culture mixed flora      IMPRESSION/PLAN:  64 year old male with relapsed refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma who recently started talquetamab (1/24) and over the past few days has developed asymptomatic erythematous patches symmetrically distributed on the neck, chest, and extremities with prominent palmoplantar involvement. Overall suspect this cutaneous eruption is most likely related to talquetamab, which causes skin  reactions in approximately 70% of patients (PMID: 42706237), the most frequent of which is hand-foot syndrome, which presents as bilateral palmoplantar diffuse inflammatory lesions (PMID: 62831517). Skin biopsy is unlikely to be of diagnostic utility at this time and we recommend continued symptomatic treatment with a topical steroid as below.    Toxic erythema of chemotherapy was considered given the morphology and distribution of his rash; however, this is appears less likely given timing of rash onset (patient **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** finished chemotherapy 1 month ago) and isatuximab/carfizomib are not commonly implicated drugs in TEC. DIHS/DRESS syndrome was also considered given recent fevers and initiation of allopurinol 10 days ago; however this is unlikely as the patient lacks lymphadenopathy, facial edema, eosinophilia, and LFT abnormalities.    Recommendations  - Continue triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID to all affected areas, particularly on the hands and feet       Thank you for involving Korea in the care of this patient.

INDICATION:   This is a 58 year-old male with a history of mutliple myeloma. The patient presents with right arm swelling.    PREVIOUS EXAMINATIONS:  None    EQUIPMENT:  Philips iU-22          FINDINGS:    UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS DUPLEX  RIGHT   Deep System:  Internal Jugular Vein peripheral: normal flow direction, complete color filling, decreased pulsatility, no intraluminal echoes  Internal Jugular Vein central:  absent color filling, Doppler silent, occlusive intraluminal echoes    Distal Innominate Vein: normal flow direction, complete color filling, decreased pulsatility, no intraluminal echoes    Subclavian Vein Prox: normal flow direction, complete color filling, decreased pulsatility, no intraluminal echoes  Subclavian Vein Distal: normal flow direction, complete color filling, decreased pulsatility, no intraluminal echoes    Doppler flow signals obtained from the axillary and brachial veins are spontaneous and phasic with decreased pulsatility.    Complete vein wall compression is noted on  B-mode image throughout the axillary, paired brachial, paired radial and paired ulnar veins with no intraluminal echoes visualized on B-mode image.    Superficial System:  Cephalic, median cubital, and basilic veins demonstrate spontaneous Doppler flow signals. Complete vein wall compression is noted **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** on B-mode image throughout these vessels.    LEFT   Deep System:  Doppler flow signals obtained from the subclavian vein are symmetric, spontaneous, phasic, and pulsatile.    Bernette Mayers, PAC and Tawanna Sat, MD was contacted today with the preliminary results of this examination.     Malachi Paradise, RVT RPhS  Vascular Technologist    FINAL PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATION    UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS  RIGHT  - There is evidence of age-indeterminate deep vein thrombosis in the proximal (central) segment of the right internal jugular vein. The distal (peripheral) and mid segments of the right internal jugular vein are patent.  - The right innominate vein and proximal subclavian vein are patent but show abnormal nearly continuous flow patterns, suggestive of a more proximal (central) venous obstruction.      - No other evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity.  - No superficial vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity, where evaluated.    I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the report (or as edited).       Assessment and Plan:  Mr. Ercel Pepitone Klyde Banka is a 43 year old male with relapsed refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma who is pre-BCMA directed CAR-T cells with Carvykti, admitted for bridging therapy with Talquetamab ramp-up.       Oncology:  - For complete disease and treatment history please see prior notes and H&P.   - 1st leukopheresis 12/7, but out of spec due to low cell count requiring re-collection. Bridging chemotherapy with isatuximab/Carfizomib/Dexamethasone (last dose 1/3)  - Recollected 1/23/2024  - MM markers (1/24): KFLC 204, LFLC < 0.15, ratio >1456.71,  M spike 2.6 IgG kappa, Kappa free light chain TSTQ.  - Concern for progressive disease with worsening bone pain of the left fibula that radiates to the lower back. Outpatient workup showed no signs of fracture.  MRI L spine + pelvis done (1/24): Large ventral epidural soft tissue tumor with severe central stenosis Bilsky grade 3, as above  Treated with 8 Gy radiation to the spine (1/31)  Neuro surg consulted: Reassured by neuro exam that there is no need for emergent surgery. No restriction to activity. Recommended Aspen TLSO brace when OOB for comfort.    MRI Brain (1/26) with new R frontal dural lesion, lesion to L orbital roof and throughout the calvarium  XR L spine Flexion/extension (1/29): similar degree of anterior wedging at T11-L1 vertebrae with additional endplate changes of L2 vertebra. Similar degree of kyphosis. No signs of instability.   MRI C and T spine (1/29): Diffuse metastases throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine with multiple pathologic compression fractures similar to 1/25. No new fractures. Mild soft tissue invasion of the right C4-C5 paraspinal musculature, no epidural or leptomeningeal enhancement.   MRI femur/Tib/fib (2/2): Diffuse marrow replacement throughout the pelvis and left femur, visualized right femur, with multiple marrow replacing lesions throughout the left tibia and fibula compatible with history of multiple myeloma. No acute fracture.   - Talquetamab ramp-up.   Day 1 (1/24): 0.01 mg/kg  Day 4 (1/27): 0.06 mg/kg  Day 7 (1/30): 0.4 mg/kg; all doses tolerated well    Hematology:  - Pancytopenia without neutropenia. Due to underlying malignancy and Talquetamab treatment.   GCSF if Pullman <500. None given this hospitalization.   - DVT of Right upper extremity. Found 2/4 on doppler:   Evidence of age-indeterminate deep vein thrombosis in the proximal (central) segment of the right internal **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** jugular vein. The distal (peripheral) and mid segments of the right internal jugular vein are  patent.The right innominate vein and proximal subclavian vein are patent but show abnormal nearly continuous flow patterns, suggestive of a more proximal (central) venous obstruction.      IR consulted concerning R port, recommended CTV for further assessment. Will decide to remove or keep line pending CTV.   Anticoagulation with heparin ggt (2/4-)   - Transfusion thresholds: Hct<25%, Plt<50K (anticoagulation with heparin). Pre-meds: diphenhydramine PO 59m and acetaminophen PO 6548mfor RBCs and only diphenhydramine PO 2520mor platelets.     Infectious disease:  - Non-neutropenic fevers (1/31-).

The patient had a port placed at an OSH. VIR was contacted as the patient has new right arm swelling. Doppler evaluation was significant for age-indeterminate DVT in the right IJ. In addition, there was decreased phasicity of the central thoracic veins though they appeared patent. The patient is reportedly not having any symptoms consistent with thoracic central venous obstruction at this time. He was started on a heparin gtt with plans to start a DOAC. Review of the chest imaging reveals a right subclavian approach catheter that terminates in the mid SVC.         Plan:   -CTV to evaluate thoracic central venous anatomy and presence of any thrombus   -Recommend 3 months of LMWH therapeutic anticoagulation for catheter associated DVT  -Given the position of the catheter (too short), this port catheter should be revised on a non-urgent basis.

CONTRAST:  IOHEXOL 350 MG/ML IV SOLN,90 mL Intravenous,02/04/2024 2130    COMPARISON:  CT chest without contrast from 2/23/2022    FINDINGS:    VASCULATURE:  There is complete occlusion/thrombosis of the lower right internal jugular vein.    The right chest wall port catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The superior right brachiocephalic vein along the course of the catheter is diminutive in caliber and may be stenotic (example 303/56). There are a few small chest wall venous collaterals, notably with a prominent right internal mammary vein. There are a few nonocclusive small calcifications along the course of the catheter  within the SVC, which may represent chronic calcified thrombi or fibrin sheaths. The remaining central veins are widely patent without thrombosis or stenosis.    Other findings:  Thyroid: Unremarkable.  Thoracic lymph nodes: **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** No enlarged thoracic lymph nodes.  Other cardiovascular: Calcification within the mid SVC, likely from prior line placement (301/188). Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. Normal caliber of the aorta and main pulmonary artery trunk. Mild coronary calcifications.  Lungs: Bibasilar left greater than right atelectasis. Calcified granulomas. There are a few small nodules in the right middle lobe and inferior right lower lobe (example 302/171).  Pleura: No effusion. No pneumothorax.  Bones: Diffuse heterogeneity, particularly in the spine, sternum, bilateral humeri, and multiple ribs, consistent with known myeloma. Compared to the PET/CT from July 2023, there are slightly increased soft tissue components surrounding a few of the rib lesions. Chronic L1 height loss. Redemonstrated irregularity of the L2 superior endplate, concerning for acute fracture.  Upper abdomen: Unremarkable.  Impression: 1.  There is complete occlusion/thrombosis of the lower right internal jugular vein.    2.  The superior right brachiocephalic vein along the course of the port catheter is diminutive in caliber and may be at least partially stenotic. There are also a few small nonocclusive calcifications along the SVC, which may represent chronic thrombi or fibrin sheaths. The remaining central venous veins are widely patent.    3.  Few new small nodules in the right middle and lower lobes, which may be sequela of aspiration or mild infection.    4.  Redemonstrated diffuse heterogeneity of the bones, consistent with known myeloma.    I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the report (or as edited).       Assessment and Plan:  Mr. Yochanan Dempewolf Iran Walkenhorst is a 50 year old male with relapsed refractory IgG  kappa multiple myeloma who is pre-BCMA directed CAR-T cells with Carvykti, admitted for bridging therapy with Talquetamab ramp-up.        Oncology:  - For complete disease and treatment history please see prior notes and H&P.   - 1st leukopheresis 12/7, but out of spec due to low cell count requiring re-collection. Bridging chemotherapy with isatuximab/Carfizomib/Dexamethasone (last dose 1/3)  - Recollected 1/23/2024  - MM markers (1/24): KFLC 204, LFLC < 0.15, ratio >1456.71, M spike 2.6 IgG kappa, Kappa free light chain TSTQ.  - Concern for progressive disease with worsening bone pain of the left fibula that radiates to the lower back. Outpatient workup showed no signs of fracture.  MRI L spine + pelvis done (1/24): Large ventral epidural soft tissue tumor with severe central stenosis Bilsky grade 3, as above  Treated with 8 Gy radiation to the spine (1/31)  Neuro surg consulted: Reassured by neuro exam that there is no need for emergent surgery. No restriction to activity. Recommended Aspen TLSO brace when OOB for comfort.    MRI Brain (1/26) with new R frontal dural lesion, lesion to L orbital roof and throughout the calvarium  XR L spine Flexion/extension (1/29): similar degree of anterior wedging at T11-L1 vertebrae with additional endplate changes of L2 vertebra. Similar degree of kyphosis. No signs of instability.   MRI C and T spine (1/29): Diffuse metastases throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine with multiple pathologic compression fractures similar to 1/25. No new fractures. Mild soft tissue invasion of the right C4-C5 paraspinal musculature, no epidural or leptomeningeal enhancement.   MRI femur/Tib/fib (2/2): Diffuse marrow replacement throughout the pelvis and left femur, visualized right femur, with multiple marrow replacing lesions throughout the left tibia and fibula compatible with history of multiple myeloma. No acute fracture.   - Talquetamab ramp-up.   Day 1 (1/24): **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** 0.01 mg/kg  Day 4 (1/27):  0.06 mg/kg  Day 7 (1/30): 0.4 mg/kg; all doses tolerated well apart from extensive rash.   - Planning for Talquetamab dose 9m 2/7. MST placed. Consider dose reducing considering rash with previous doses, see below.     Hematology:  - Pancytopenia without neutropenia. Due to underlying malignancy and Talquetamab treatment.   GCSF if APonca<500. None given this hospitalization.   - DVT of Right upper extremity. Found 2/4 on doppler: Evidence of age-indeterminate deep vein thrombosis in the proximal (central) segment of the right internal jugular vein.     CTV showing complete occlusion/thrombosis of the lower right internal jugular vein.   IR consulted concerning R port, recommended anticoagulation and outpatient procedure to address port placement. No plans to remove line at this time.   Anticoagulation with heparin (2/4-2/5) Switched to lovenox (2/5-)  Discussed with wife (2/5) - she feels comfortable administering lovenox shots at home following discharge. Would prefer lovenox over DOAC given easier reversibility for possible IR procedures with line. Discuss scheduling training with transition tomorrow (2/6)  - Transfusion thresholds: Hct<25%, Plt<50K (anticoagulation). Pre-meds: diphenhydramine PO 269mand acetaminophen PO 65050mor RBCs and only diphenhydramine PO 84m44mr platelets.     Infectious disease:  - Gram positive rod bacteremia (2/4-). On Bcx from line (2/4). Presented with non-neutropenic fevers (1/31-). Thought secondary to CRS vs. Thrombosis vs. Infectious etiology  Workup: blood cultures (1/31, 2/2): NGTD. Bcx (2/4) + Gram positive rods.   Bcx (2/5) from line and peripheral pending   UA positive for bacteria and yeast. Urine culture (2/2): mixed flora. Ucx (2/4) pending. Chest xray (2/2): clear lungs.  Treatment: Cefepime (2/5-) and Vancomycin (2/5-) per pharmacy curbside  - Prophylaxis: Valacyclovir      Regimen related toxicity:  - CRS (1/31- ), Max Grade 1 (fever and mild hypotension that  resolved with fluids), Current Grade 0  - At risk for ICANS. ICE scores 10/10  ICE scores q12hrs (modified to count up to 100 by 10s and write name; pt unable to read or write at baseline).  Daily inflammatory markers.  - At risk for TLS. Continue allopurinol.  - At risk for CINV. PRN IV and PO ondansetron available.  - Maculopapular rash (2/2- ). Continuously evolving. Across chest and medial aspect of bilateral arms as well as the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet. No recent medication changes. Most consistent with drug rash due to Talquetamab.  Dermatology Consulted, appreciate recs. See note from 2/3.  Literature suggests that the hand-foot pattern of this maculopapular rash may be consistent with similar skin reactions seen from TalqEl Cenizoinistration and occurs in 70% of patients.   Triamcinolone cream 1% to the affected area, especially the hands and feet.  - GERD. Continue omeprazole. PRN tums available  - Deconditioned. PT and OT re-consulted (2/5) for follow up    Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition:  - Eating and drinking adequately. RD following.  - Electrolyte derangements.  Hypomagnesia. Continue 800 mg BID. Additional PRN replacement as needed.  Hypokalemia. Continue 40 meq BID.   Hyponatremia (1/29 - ). Fluctuating.  Workup (2/2): Serum osom 282. Urine sodium 19. Urine osm 540.

INTERVAL HISTORY:  - No acute events overnight. Afebrile, HDS  - Pt overall feels well today  - Rash is still present to the top of his feet and shins but is resolved to the arms, palms, shins, and soles of feet. Non pruritic. Using triamcinolone cream on remaining areas  - Eating and drinking well. No n/v  - Having regular, soft Bms. Requesting to be sent home with a script for miralax  - Ambulating comfortably with TLSO brace and walker with assistance from his wife. Denies any LE weakness or pain.   - Pain well controlled on MS contin. No PRN oxy used in several days  - Denies fever, chills, rash, headache, cough, congestion, sore throat, SOB, chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, dysuria, swelling, or bleeding.     HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM LIST:       PROBLEM 1 - PROTOCOLS:    The patient was enrolled and treated on the following protocols: N/A    PROBLEM 2 - BRIDGING THERAPY:  Talquetamab ramp-up:  S/p day 1 (1/24): 0.01 mg/kg  S/p day 4 (1/27): 0.06 mg/kg.   S/p day 7 (1/30): 0.4 mg/kg  Doses tolerated well other than grade 1 CRS and skin rash.     PROBLEM 4 - HEMATOLOGY:    Patient received 4 RBC transfusions and 3 platelet transfusions during the duration of this hospitalization.  Transfusion thresholds: Hct<25%, Plt<50K (anticoagulation). Pre-meds:  diphenhydramine PO 95m and acetaminophen PO 6547mfor RBCs and only diphenhydramine PO 2532mor platelets.       Patient did not receive G-CSF.     DVT of Right IJ. Found on doppler 2/4 and CTV 2/4. IR was consulted and his port was also found to be suboptimally  placed in the mid SVC. IR recommended 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation and to follow up with IR on an outpatient basis for non urgent procedure to advance port catheter. Port is fully functional. Pt's wife received education on lovenox injection and is comfortable performing injections.     PROBLEM 5 - INFECTIOUS DISEASE:    (a) Fever of unknown origin:   1/31, 2/1. Thought to be secondary to CRS vs thrombosis. Infectious work up was negative.     (c) Documented bacterial infections:   Gram positive rod bacteremia identified on Bcx from line to anaerobic broth only (2/4). Bacteria not identified on mass spectrometry and was a possible contaminant, per micro. Consider not treating considering repeat Bcx NGTD.    Treatment: Cefepime (2/5-2/7) and Vancomycin (2/5-2/7).   Antibiotics were stopped on recommendation from micro when bacteria could not be speciated or further identified on testing. Remained afebrile for 24 hours and without new symptoms after stopping abx.     (d) Documented fungal infections:    none    (e) Documented viral infections:   Acyclovir ppx    PROBLEM 8 - REGIMEN-RELATED TOXICITY:    He was monitored for CRS and ICANS post talquetamab injections. His ICE score scale was modified scale due to language **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** barrier and literacy. His ICE score was 9/10 on 1/28, unable to state name of hospital, but it was not clear that this is related to ICANS vs language barrier vs fatigue. He had a max grade 1 CRS due to fever and mild hypotension that resolved with fluids.     Risk for TLS- uric acid remained normal. Continues on allopurinol.      Maculopapular rash, presenting on 2/2. Likely secondary to talquetamab. Dermatology consult (2/3) with recs for triamcinolone cream 1%.

Jatniel is a 47 year old gentleman with multiple myeloma preparing for treatment with the BCMA-targeted CAR T cell product Carvykti on a standard treatment plan.  Also present were Dewitt Hoes (his wife and caregiver), Dr Natasha Bence, MD, PhD, the Centreville interpreter, and IMTX Linganore, RN.     SUMMARY OF ONCOLOGY HISTORY  For a detailed history, please refer to the arrival note dated 11/28/23 by Dr Elisabeth Pigeon, MD, and the H&P by Marisa Severin, PA-C dated 11/27/2023. To briefly summarize: Mr Lucio Edward was first diagnosed with IgG kappa myeloma in March 2019 after presenting with bilateral rib pain that he thought was related to his occupation. He received CyBorD followed by lenalidomide maintenance until progression. He then received RVD, but his disease progressed through this, so daratumumab was added. When his disease progressed again, he was put back on CyBorD, which was then followed by carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (KPd) with palliative radiation to several sites of active disease. This was followed by consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation following high-dose melphalan in June 2022. He was given maintenance pomalidomide, but when there was concern for progression, he was put back on KPd, but this provided only transient response.  In August 2023, he was given PACE, which was complicated by pneumonia, respiratory failure, and AKI. Instead of repeating this regimen, he was then given doxorubicin, bortezomib, and dexamethasone starting on 11/13/2023 with a goal of using this to ultimately facilitate arrival to our team for subsequent treatment with CAR T-cells.   1st leukapheresis was attempted on 12/7/23 but, unfortunately, cells were out of specification due to low cell count, requiring re-collection, repeated on 1/23.  ujyf    Unfortunately despite bridging with isatuximab-carfilzomib-dexamethasone, Mr Lucio Edward developed worsening weakness. His laboratory studies from 1/9/23 suggested disease progression with increased total protein and mild hypercalcemia. A spine MRI on 01/11/24 showed chronic mild compression deformities of T3, T6, T9, and L1. STIR signal abnormality involving multiple vertebral levels. Enhancement at multiple levels, most significant at the T11 and T12 vertebral bodies. He had severe back pain and an MRI L spine (1/24) showed large ventral epidural soft tissue mass extending from L2-L4, severe L3-L4 canal stenosisis with complete effacement of thecal sac and clumping of cauda equia nerve roots. MRI pelvis: Lesion in L sacral ala extending into the L s1 neural foramen. Repeated MRI CT spine (1/29): diffuse localizations throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine with multiple pathologic fractures. He received XRT 800 Gy to lumbar epidural soft tissue mass with resolution of LLE and back pain. He then received C1D15 bridging Talquetamab administered on 02/09 and on 02/16.    DATA REVIEW  We reviewed and discussed the following tests results:  WBC 4.05, ANC 2.39, ALC 1.05, platelets 60. The patient is still requiring intermittent platelet transfusions.  AST 19, ALT 19, total bilirubin 0.4, creatinine 0.50. Alk phos: 217, uric acid 3.1.  PSA 2/29/24: 0.20.   Creatinine/24h urine 836. K BJP present.    Negative toxoplasmosis serology.  Negative HSV-1 serology.   Negative HSV-2 serology.  Negative VZV serology.  Positive CMV serology.  HBs Ag, anti-HIV, anti-HBc, anti-HTLV1/2, anti-HCV, Syphillis testing, was negative.  COVID-19 testing on 2/5/24 was negative.    On 02/22/24, KFLC were 16.18; LFLC <0.15; FLC ratio >115.57. SPEP and serum IF showed IgG kappa M-spike (1.0 quant) **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** and a second monoclonal KLC component.     Bone marrow biopsy 02/20/24: low-volume (<1%) residual involvement by kappa light chain restriction atypical  plasma cells compatible with residual plasma cell neoplasm.  Bone marrow flow cytometry does not identify any abnormal immature B-cell population.  Suboptimal sample; normocellular bone marrow with erythroid predominance, reduction in myeloid lineage cells and with presence of atypical megakaryocytes. Cytogenetics: normal male karyotype.    PET-CT on 02/21/24: Compared to prior PET/CT scan dated July 20, 2023, there is overall significant interval decrease in the FDG avidity of the hypermetabolic osseous lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, some of which have corresponding lytic lesions on CT scan. Significant interval decrease in size and FDG avidity of the previously noted bilateral lower lung groundglass and nodular opacities. No new hypermetabolic osseous or extraosseous lesions. Interval decreased metabolic activity in the anal region, could be inflammatory. Hypermetabolic focus in the right prostate, maximum SUV of 4.9, prostate neoplasm cannot be excluded. PSA level correlation is suggested.    MRI 02/21/24: Compared to MRI brain on 1/26/2024, interval right progression of intraosseous foci of enhancement but with decreased dural/pachymeningeal soft tissue involvement. No evidence of involvement of the brain parenchyma. Similar to slightly increased bony involvement of the left orbital roof lesion but with decreased intraorbital involvement.    XR osseous survey 02/27/24: Redemonstration of findings consistent with multiple myeloma, with evidence of progression most notable at the calvarium when compared to prior bone survey from December 2023.     Chest X ray 02/02/24: Lungs are clear. Heart and mediastinal contours are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality. The right chest wall port catheter terminates in the mid SVC.    EKG 11/30/23: sinus tachycardia, otherwise normal EKG. QTC 435.  TT ECHO 11/30/23: Normal left and right ventricular size and  function. LV ejection fraction is 58%. Normal global longitudinal strain at - -19%.       DISCUSSION    We discussed the biological concepts underlying CAR-T cell therapy, that it is gene therapy, that the antigen targeted is BCMA, also expressed on normal B cells and plasma cells.     We discussed the most common side effects of lymphodepletion chemotherapy with Cytoxan and fludarabine: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cystitis, low blood counts, tumor lysis syndrome. Lymphodepletion is usually administered in outpatient setting.    We discussed the risks of hypersensitivity reactions shortly after CAR T-cell infusion. In case of cryopreserved products, we discussed the low risk of toxicities associated with DMSO, such as with fevers, chills, flushing, GI symptoms, cardiovascular events, and renal dysfunction.    We discussed cytokine release syndrome, occurring within a few days post CAR T-cell infusion in 70-90% of patients, consisting of high-grade fevers, shaking chills, tachycardia, low blood pressure. I mentioned that approximately 5-10% of patients may require ICU care for low blood pressure, respiratory failure, organ dysfunction. I explained that CRS can be fatal in some cases. We discussed that a higher tumor burden is associated with a higher risk of severe CRS.    We discussed neurologic toxicity after CAR-T cell therapy. I explained that it is classically delayed after CRS, presenting with word-finding difficulties, headaches, confusion, delirium. We discussed that severe neurologic toxicity has been reported 10 to 30% of patients. We discussed the risk of severe neurologic toxicity with seizures and coma, and that a few cases of fatal cerebral edema have been reported.     We discussed the risk of severe, potentially fatal, **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** infections after lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR-T cell infusion. We also discussed the risk of prolonged cytopenia, potentially requiring transfusions and growth factor  administration for a few weeks to a few months after CAR-T cell therapy.    Overall, I explained that the risk of treatment-related mortality after CAR T-cell therapy is estimated in the 2-4% range, nowadays primarily due to infectious complications.    I explained that CAR-T cell is gene therapy, with a potential risk of insertional mutagenesis and secondary malignancies (""T-cell tumor""). Hence, we are required by the FDA of a 15-year follow-up. I explained the goals of our LTFU program. We discussed the risk of infections due to B cell aplasia, and the potential need for treatment with IV immunoglobulins.     Last, I reviewed the need for a full-time care giver for the duration of treatment at Adventhealth Murray, and to reside within 30 minutes of the Fieldstone Center for at least 4 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion. I explained that a Pronghorn will have to be identified and documented.     At the end of our conversation, the patient voiced his understanding of the potential risks and benefits of his  treatment plan, and agreed to move forward with CAR T-cell therapy on a standard treatment plan.     I gave the patient many opportunities to ask questions, which I answered to the best of my knowledge and to their satisfaction.  Thank you for referring Mr. Mattheus Lugg to the Surgicenter Of Eastern Carolina LLC Dba Vidant Surgicenter Immunotherapy clinic. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via phone or email.    Sincerely,    Alden Benjamin, MD, PhD  Charlyn Minerva Cancer Center, Gilbertsville of California, Myrtle Grove of Hematology and Oncology  liovino'@fredhutch'$ .org    TIME STATEMENT    I spent a total time of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which more than 50% was spent in counseling and coordination of care as outlined in this note."

Mr. Marvion Bastidas received isatuximab/carfilzomib/dexamethasone for bridging chemotherapy from 12/27/2023 to 1/17/2024 with no response. He then received talquetamab from 1/24/2024 to 2/16/2024. Additionally received XRT to L2-L4 with 8 Gy in 1 fraction on 1/31/2024.    SUMMARY OF TREATMENT COURSE  For more details regarding the patient's treatment course, please refer to the note by Teofilo Pod, PA-C dated on 4/17/2024.  The patient arrived to our clinic on 11/27/2023.    Pretreatment disease restaging showed:  - Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (2/20/2024):  low-volume (< 1%) residual involvement by kappa light chain restriction atypical plasma cells compatible with residual plasma cell neoplasm. Flow cytometry does not identify any abnormal immature B-cell population. An abnormal plasma cell population was identified by flow cytometry representing 0.02% of the total white cells and  having abnormal expression of CD19 (absent), CD38 (absent), CD45 (absent), CD56, and monoclonal kappa cytoplasmic light  chain restriction with normal expression of CD138. In total, plasma cells represent 0.04 % of the total white cells, including 0.02  % polytypic plasma cells. Suboptimal sample; normocellular bone marrow with erythroid predominance, reduction in myeloid lineage cells and with presence of atypical megakaryocytes. Myeloma FISH results on enriched CD138+ cells abnormal with 4 to 5 copies of 1q.  - PET/CT (2/21/2024): overall significant interval decrease in the FDG avidity of the hypermetabolic osseous lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, some of which have corresponding lytic lesions on CT scan. No new hypermetabolic osseous or extraosseous lesions.  - MRI brain (2/21/2024): compared to MRI brain on 1/26/2024, interval right progression of intraosseous foci of enhancement but with decreased dural/pachymeningeal soft tissue involvement. No evidence of involvement of the brain parenchyma. Similar to slightly increased bony involvement of the left orbital roof lesion but with decreased intraorbital involvement.  - MRI C-T spine (1/29/2024): diffuse metastases throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine with multiple pathologic compression fractures which are similar when compared with CT 1/25/2024. No new fractures. Mild soft tissue invasion of the right C4-C5 paraspinal musculature. No epidural or leptomeningeal enhancement.  - MRI lumbar spine (1/24/2024): diffusely heterogeneous marrow signal consistent with given history of multiple **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** myeloma. Large ventral  epidural soft tissue tumor extending from L2 through L4, Bilsky grade 3. Resulting severe central stenosis at L3-4 with complete effacement of the thecal sac and clumping of the cauda equina nerve roots likely reflecting a component of arachnoiditis. Tumor also extends into the L3-4 and L4-5 neural foramina contributing to moderate to severe foraminal stenoses. Bilsky grade 1B ventral epidural soft tissue tumors at L1 and L2. Additional focal lesions in the partially seen T11 and T12 vertebral bodies.

He did not develop neurologic toxicity/ICANS.    Post-treatment disease restaging showed:  - Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (4/8/2024): limited marrow biopsy with no morphologic or flow cytometric evidence of residual plasma cell neoplasm. Normal male karyotype. ClonoSEQ pending.  - PET/CT (4/11/2024): stable mild diffuse FDG uptake within the osseous lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, in keeping with ongoing response to treatment. New, moderately avid right lower lobe groundglass opacities and atelectasis, likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology. Redemonstrated hypermetabolic focus in the right prostate which could represent inflammation versus less likely neoplasm, given recent PSA (2/29/2024) was within normal limits.  - **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** MRI brain (4/10/2024): compared to MRI of head February 21, 2024, stable appearance of multiple bony foci of enhancement.

Finding may represent post-treatment change. Interval decrease conspicuity of previously visualized osseous lesions. No new osseous lesion or pathological fracture is identified. Interval resolution of epidural disease extension within the lumbar spine. The enhancement within the lumbar foramen zone has also  resolved with decreased extracortical enhancement at right posterior L3 element. Interval resolution of paraspinal musculature invasion at right C4-5. No signal abnormality within the spinal cord. No new left meningeal enhancement.

DISCUSSION/RECOMMENDATIONS   We started our conversation by reviewing his recent treatment course. We reviewed his response to treatment, as detailed above.    We discussed the risk of relapse after BCMA-targeted CAR T-cell therapy with Carvykti.    We discussed I would recommend he undergoes assessment of his disease activity using blood SPEP, serum free light chains, and immunofixation initially monthly and, if improving depth of response, then every 3 months. I also explained causes of pseudoprogression on PET imaging. Given residual FDG uptake in osseous lesions and multiple bony foci of enhancement in the MRI brain, I would recommend follow-up PET/CT and MRI brain and C-T-L spine **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** at 3 after CAR T-cell infusion.    We discussed a side effect of BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapy is depletion of normal plasma cells and therefore possible hypogammaglobulinemia with increased risk for infections (encapsulated bacteria). Therefore, we recommend monitoring IgG levels every 1-2 months. If levels become < 400, repletion with IVIG can be considered per standard guidelines if the patient is suffering from frequent infections.    We recommend the COVID-19 vaccine (3 injections) and the Flu vaccine to be done 3-6 months after CAR-T cell therapy.In addition, we are recommending revaccinations beginning 6 months post CAR T cell therapy. The 4 inactivated vaccines recommended are: Prevnar 13 for Streptococcus pneumoniae; Tdap (or DTaP) for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis; Hib for Haemophilus influenza type B and Twinrix for hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus. Ideally, titers for these vaccines should be drawn prior to vaccination and then 1-2 months following the vaccine to assess for response. If the patient becomes seroprotective, no additional vaccination required. However, if there is response but not seroprotective, then  give additional vaccination. And if no response, then additional vaccination should be deferred until further markers for immune reconstitution are met. Please refer to vaccination guideline handout in our discharge packet for further clarification.     We also recommend HSV/VZV prophylaxis with valacyclovir for at least 1 year, and PJP prophylaxis with Dapsone twice a day for at least 6 months and CD4+ T-cell count > 200/L.    We discussed risks of persistent or new cytopenia for several months after CAR T-cell therapy, potentially requiring frequent transfusions and/or growth factors.    I explained that due to the hypothetical risk of insertional mutagenesis and secondary malignancies, persistence of replication-competent lentiviral particles, a 15-year follow-up is required by the FDA.     We discussed that he should refrain from driving for two months after CAR T-cell therapy. We advise the use of barrier contraception for at least 1 year after CAR T-cell infusion.    ASSESSMENT/PLAN  Mr. Travanti Mcmanus Juwan Vences is a 67 year old patient with relapsed/refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma, in partial response at day 28 after BCMA-targeted cell therapy with Carvykti (cilta-cel). This was complicated with grade 1 CRS and no ICANS, now resolved.    Residual issues are:  - Prolonged cytopenias: continue to monitor CBC with differential weekly and administer G-CSF 5g/kg/day as needed to maintain ANC > 500/L. If cytopenia persist after day +90, please contact me directly. Transfuse platelets for threshold of 50,000 given ongoing enoxaparin for history of right IJ DVT on 2/4/2024.  - Complete 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation with enoxaparin for DVT (through 5/4/2024).  - Hypermetabolic focus in the right prostate. Follow-up on next PET/CT.    I gave Glenwood and his caregiver many opportunities to ask questions, which I answered to the best of my knowledge and to their satisfaction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient's oncologic history is well documented in the Arrival H&P by Tommye Standard, PA-C, completed on 11/27/23. For the purposes of this discharge summary documentation, I have summarized this history as below.     - Diagnosed in March 2019, presenting with posterior bilateral rib pain, and found to have extensive metastatic disease in the spine and ribs.  - Treated with CyBorD x 6 cycles (3/2019-11/2019) with VGPR. Placed on maintenance treatment with Revlimid (12/2019-4/2020) until he had progressive disease.  - Treated with RVD (4/2020-6/2020).   - Again had progressive disease so daratumumab was added. Treated with Dara RVD (6/2020-4/2021).  - Due to progressive disease back to CyBorD (4/2021-6/2021)  - Continued to progress so put on KPD (8/2021-12/2021) + palliative radiation to right ight shoulder, left shoulder/axilla, pelvis/bilateral hip (8/2021-9/2021).  - Consolidation with autologous PBSCT on 1/21/2022, conditioned with melphalan 200 mg/msq June 2022  - Maintenance pomalidamide (6/2022-11/2022).  - Increase in myeloma markers, switched back to KPD (11/2022-6/2023). XRT to the clivus for 6th nerve palsy with 3000cGy (12/2022)  - Continued progression led to inpatient treatment with PACE (8/2023), which was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring O2 but not ICU),  pneumonia and AKI.  - Palliative XRT to right rib, T10-12, T1-7 (10/2023), XRT to right pelvis/right tibia (11/2023)  - Chose not to repeat PACE give course complications and instead gave doxorubicine, bortezomib, and dexamethatsone starting 11/2023 with goal of facilitating arrival to Willoughby Surgery Center LLC team for CAR-T cell therapy.    IMMUNOTHERAPY HISTORY       T CELL COLLECTION     Robertt underwent apheresis for T cell collection on 12/7/23 without incident. Unfortunately, the original collected cells were out of specification due to low cell count (0.1 x 10^6/kg, clinical specification target dose is 0.5-1.0 x 10^6/kg). A second apheresis attempt for T cell collection was completed on 1/23/24.    BRIDGING CHEMOTHERAPY  Kingjames received isatuximab/carfilzomib/dexamethasone for bridging chemotherapy from 12/27/23-1/17/24, with no response. He then received Talquetamab from 1/24-2/16/24.

Now day +37 post-CART cell therapy. See Summary Conference note by attending physician for disease monitoring/management recommendations.    Heme. Pancytopenia without neutropenia. Cytopenias following initial post-CART count recovery is a common side effect of CART cell therapy and is expected to improve over the next few weeks to months. Will receive 1 unit of platelets today to achieve platelet threshold of 50K. Remains on enoxaparin BID for history of right IJ vein DVT 2/4/24; per IR, should continue for at least 3 months (through 5/4/24) though consider extending if active disease is present.     Infections.  Afebrile.     (A) There are no current documented bacterial infections. On dapsone for PJP prophylaxis. We recommend continuing this for 6 months post CAR T cells.    (B) There are no current documented viral infections. On valacyclovir for antiviral prophylaxis. We recommend continuing this for 1 year post CAR T cells.   (C) There are no current documented fungal infections.     4.  Hypogammaglobulinemia/B cell depletion: A side effect of BCMA directed CAR T cell therapy is depletion of normal B cells and therefore possible hypogammaglobulinemia. Jarreau was noted prior to CAR T cells to have an elevated baseline IgG level of 3373mg /dL due to his IgG kappa myeloma. Post CART IgG level was drawn today, 4/17/24, and is pending. There is a potential of further reduction in IgG levels in the future and therefore, we recommend monitoring the IgG levels every 1-2 months.      5. Vaccination Recommendations:  We recommend revaccination beginning 6 months post CAR T cell therapy. The 4 inactivated vaccines recommended are: Prevnar 13 for Streptococcus pneumoniae; Tdap (or DTaP) for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis; Hib for Haemophilus influenza type B **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** and Twinrix for hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus. Ideally, titers for these vaccines should be drawn prior to vaccination and then 1-2 months following the vaccine to assess for response. If the patient becomes seroprotective, no additional vaccination required. However, if there is response but not seroprotective, then given additional vaccination. And if no response, then additional vaccination should be deferred until further markers for immune reconstitution are met. Please refer to vaccination guideline handout in our discharge packet for further clarification.

LABORATORY STUDIES    ]    IMAGING/PERTINENT STUDIES    No new imaging      ASSESSMENT/PLAN    1.  IgG kappa multiple myeloma in relapse  2.  Anemia due to myeloma  3.  AKI    Mr. Chukwudi Ewen is a 82 year old man with relapsed/refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma with baseline FISH and R-ISS stage unknown who experienced disease relapse in November 2022, about 10 months after transplant.  He was most recently on KPd but is experiencing rapid disease relapse now, with rising light chains and significantly worsening anemia and AKI today.    His prior therapies included CyBorD, Len maintenance, RVD, RVD+dara, KPd, Mel200/ASCT, pom maintenance followed by KPd again.  He is now penta-refractory.  We discussed potential therapy with CAR T-cell therapy as well as options for interim therapy due to the fact that CAR T-cell therapy is realistically an option that is still months away.    I met with the patient today to discuss treatment with CAR T cells. Specifically, the patient has relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and is a good candidate for  BCMA CAR T cells (Abecma, Ide-cel), and has had > 4 lines of therapy, including PI, IMID and CD38 antibodies. We discussed the clinical trial data for Abecma; specifically, the Mercy Medical Center-Dyersville study (Munshi et al Kavin Leech 2021), showed an ORR of 73%, and median PFS of 8.8 months, with MRD negativity in 26% of all patients. I also discussed the risks, including CRS and ICANS, both of which can be severe resulting in ICU stay, but treatable with IL6 antibodies and dexamethasone. I also reviewed additional toxicities, including cytopenias, infections, risk of secondary malignancy, and hypogammaglobulinemia. After a thorough discussion, the patient indicated interest in moving forward with CAR T therapy. I advised the patient that we will next contact the patient for insurance clearance and ROI, which will begin the process. I also explained that due to manufacturing constraints with Abecma it could be 6-9 months before the treatment can be administered.     We also discussed Carvykti (Cilta-cel). We discussed the clinical trial data for Carvykti; specifically, the CARTITUDE-1 study Marylee Floras et al Demetra Shiner 2021, Erling Conte al Mercy Hospital 2021), showed an ORR of 98%, stringent CR in 78% of patients, with MRD negativity in 92% of patients. At a median of 18 months follow up, median DOR was 21.8 months. I also discussed the **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** risks, including CRS, ICANS, both of which can be severe resulting in ICU stay, but treatable with IL6 antibodies and dexamethasone. Additional risks associated with Carvykti includes Parkinsonism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, neuropathy, cranial nerve palsies, and HLH/MAS. I also reviewed additional toxicities, including prolonged/recurrent cytopenias, infections, risk of secondary malignancy, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Treatment related mortality is 9-10%. After a thorough discussion, the patient indicated interest in moving forward with CAR T (Carvykti) therapy. I advised the patient that we will next contact the patient for  insurance clearance and ROI, which will begin the process. I also explained that due to manufacturing constraints with Carvykti it could be 6-9 months before the treatment can be administered.    We discussed that he needs more immediate therapy changes now.  Potential options include the addition of an anti-CD38 mAb such as daratumumab or isatuximab although given his rapid progression on KPd, would favor doing this with either CyBorD or RVD.  We discussed the potential option for treatment with teclistamab although this would require him to return to the Hauser Ross Ambulatory Surgical Center for weekly injections.  If he has more aggressive relapse, then would consider salvage chemotherapy, such as with RVD-PACE.    We discussed his anemia today, noting that his hemoglobin was 8.3 g/dL on 9/60/4540, then 7.1 g/dL on 9/81/1914 and now 6.3 g/dL today.  I suspect that this is contributing to his dizziness and fatigue.  In addition, his creatinine is rising, was 1.24 on 6/20, 1.7 on 6/27/2023 and 2.51 today.  We are able to transfuse 1 unit of pRBC today but will need to refer to the Neosho Memorial Regional Medical Center ED for the second unit as well as for evaluation and treatment of his AKI.  His repeat MM labs including light chains are pending today, but I suspect that his anemia  and renal dysfunction are related to relapse of his myeloma.  He is unable to stay in Maryland tonight because of his children who are at home.  He will return back home after this pRBC transfusion and will seek care locally, at the ED or with his local oncologist.    I have communicated this update to Dr. Dreama Saa who is heading out of town but will work with her covering colleague in the meantime.     - consider addition of daratumumab or isatuximab to the current regimen or consider switching to dara-CyBorD   - other potential standard of care options include selinexor with either bortezomib or carfilzomib (Xvd or XKD)   - other options include teclistamab here at Liberty Regional Medical Center or could even consider salvage  chemotherapy such as PACE.   - bone marrow biopsy - informed consent signed today   - PET/CT   - pRBC transfusion today    FOLLOW-UP  Follow-up with Dr. Dreama Saa at Virden, or return to the Hackettstown Regional Medical Center."

IMAGING/PERTINENT STUDIES    Imaging Results:  PET CT F-18 FDG Whole Body  Narrative: EXAMINATION:   PET CT WHOLE BODY    CLINICAL INDICATION:  60 year old male with IgG kappa multiple myeloma, diagnosed March 2019, status post CAR T-cell therapy, D+28. Prior FDG PET/CT showed mild diffuse FDG uptake throughout the bones.    Imaging requested for restaging.    Subsequent treatment strategy.    RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL:  FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE F-18 FDG UWM UWM INJECTION,9.9 millicurie Intravenous,06/13/2024 1100    Injection site: Right port catheter    TECHNIQUE:  Extent: Skull vertex to toes.  Uptake time: 60 minutes.  Fasting blood glucose level prior to FDG injection: 97 mg/dL.    After injection of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, nondiagnostic, noncontrast, non breathhold CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and fusion with emission PET images for anatomical localization.     Images were interpreted on Visage PACS.    COMPARISON:  PET/CT from 4/11/2024, 2/21/2024    FINDINGS:  Liver mean SUV: 2.44.  Mediastinal blood pool mean SUV: 1.84  Mediastinal blood  pool maximum SUV: 2.39    PET numbers refer to series 12 PET and series 1202 axial PET/CT fused, CT numbers to series 3 in PACS.    Cancer-related findings: **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** Medullary disease:   Similar to prior study mild diffuse FDG uptake within the bones and the lytic changes do not demonstrate uptake above surrounding bone marrow. Similar healing fracture deformities of several bilateral ribs.    Extramedullary disease:   Unremarkable.    Additional PET/CT and noncontrast CT findings:  *  Physiologic uptake in the brain, salivary glands, oropharynx, tonsils, liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract and excretion by the kidneys into the collecting systems and urinary bladder.  *  Focal increased FDG uptake in the right vocal cord is more pronounced compared to prior and likely physiologic.  *  Non-FDG avid bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.  *  Mild coronary artery calcification, which is greater than expected for the patient's age.  *  Right port a catheter with tip terminating in the lower superior vena cava and retained radiotracer related to injection. Note is made of an unchanged calcific focus within the distal SVC, possibly representing a calcified thrombus (3/143).  *  Interval resolution of the previously noted focal increased FDG uptake in the right aspect of the prostate gland.  *  Slightly asymmetric increased FDG uptake in the left aspect of the prostate gland with an SUV max of 4.3 on PET image 12/270 (right aspect of prostate with SUV max of 3.7) favors physiologic activity versus inflammation.  *  Stable scrotal calcifications.  *  Persistent focal FDG uptake within the anal canal with an SUV max of 5.4 on PET image 12/286 (previous SUV max of 6.5).  *  Mildly FDG avid subcutaneous soft tissue nodules within the right anterior abdominal wall (3/262, 12/232), likely representing injection granulomas.  *  Stable non-FDG avid sclerotic focus in the left femoral head (3/308) favors a bone island.  *   Similar compression fractures of T6 and L2.   *  Similar mild anterior wedging of T11-L1.  *  Mildly increased radiotracer uptake within the left shoulder joint, likely degenerative in etiology.  *  Increased FDG uptake at the spinous processes of the lumbar spine favors enthesopathy.  Impression: Stable mild diffuse FDG uptake within the osseous lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, in keeping with ongoing response to treatment.     Interval resolution of the previously noted focal increased FDG uptake in the right prostate and FDG avid bilateral lower lung ground glass opacities favor infection/inflammation.    Stable focal increased FDG uptake in the anal canal favors physiologic activity versus infection/inflammation. Would recommend clinical correlation and attention on follow-up imaging.    I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the report (or as edited).

Cervical spine:  T1 hypointensity, consistent with marrow replacement, is similar to the previous study.  No change in mild  enhancement.  No epidural enhancement or pathologic fracture.     Thoracic spine: Unchanged appearance of compression fractures at T3, T6, T9, possibly T11 and T12.  No new fractures.  No epidural disease.     Lumbar spine: Compression fractures of L1 and L2, unchanged.  No new fractures.  STIR hyperintensity in the T12-L5 vertebral bodies, sacrum, iliac bones, as before.  Slight decrease in enhancement of the lumbar vertebral bodies, uncertain significance.  Enhancement in the extensor muscles, most marked on the right at L4-L5, is unchanged.

The lateral ventricles are symmetric. The ventricles, sulci and cisterns are normal.  BRAIN:  Similar multiple small nonspecific foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in cerebral  white matter. No acute infarct, hemorrhage or intra-axial mass lesion is seen.    VASCULAR:  Cavernous carotid, vertebral, and other intracranial vascular flow voids are preserved.  EXTRA-AXIAL: Similar focal dural thickening and enhancement at the left parietal convexity (2401/109, 2402/165).  EXTRA-CRANIAL/ENHANCEMENT: Innumerable enhancing osseous lesions in the calvarium, skull base, and included mandible and upper cervical spine are again visualized, however there is interval decrease in enhancement and multiple lesions for instance a previously avidly enhancing lesion in the left parietal bone measuring 1.2 cm previously measured 1.7 cm (2401:130).  Diffuse paranasal sinus mucosal thickening with fluid and air-fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. Orbits are normal.      IMPRESSION     Compared to MRI of the brain on April 10, 2024:  1. Interval decrease in enhancement of multiple enhancing osseous lesions, predominantly within the **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** calvarium.   2. Similar focal dural thickening and enhancement at the left parietal convexity. No new intracranial lesions or acute intracranial abnormality.  3. Paranasal sinus mucosal disease with air-fluid level in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, to be correlated clinically for acute sinusitis.     I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the report (or as edited).           Specimen Collected: 06/13/24 15:41 Last Resulted: 06/13/24 18:09             ASSESSMENT/PLAN    1.  IgG kappa multiple myeloma in relapse  2.  S/p CAR T-cell therapy    Mr. Vytautas Barbieri is a 30 year old man with relapsed/refractory IgG kappa multiple myeloma with FISH notable for the adverse cytogenetic findings of complex karyotype and FISH notable for amplification of 1q and t(4;14) who has experienced aggressive relapses of disease, including extramedullary disease requiring radiation therapy.  He is now D+106 from Cilta-Cel achieving a VGPR with negative bone marrow biopsy  (suspect IgG kappa is still clearing).  MRD assessment with clonoseq is still pending at this time.    He continues to recover well from CAR T-cell therapy, with no recent infection.    We reviewed his PET/CT which is most consistent with ongoing response to therapy but not negative as of yet.  In light of this we favor monitoring with follow-up PET/CT after 6 months.     Otherwise there is no role for additional therapy at this time, such as maintenance therapy.  Recommend ongoing monitoring of myeloma with SPEP and free light chains every 3 months.     - follow-up on results of MRD testing   - no role for maintenance therapy   - would monitor MM with SPEP and free light chains every 3 months    - recommend repeat PET/CT in 6 months   - follow-up brain MRI to evaluate dural thickening   - continue dapsone for PJP prophylaxis until D+180   - continue valacyclovir for viral prophylaxis   - consider annual bone marrow biopsy including MRD assessment with Clonoseq   - consider IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia associated with CAR T-cell therapy (I.e. if IgG <400 mg/dL), as noted now    3.  Abnormal PET scan      - recommend colonoscopy to evaluate FDG uptake in the anal canal     4.  Elevated ferritin  We note that he has ferritin elevation.  Inflammation seems less likely given normal CRP.  Could be iron overload although he does not recall receiving excessive pRBC transfusions.  We will monitor for now but once anemia is improved will reassess for possible transfusion related iron overload versus other causes of iron overload   - monitor ferritin    FOLLOW-UP  Follow-up with Dr. Dreama Saa at Wilmington Surgery Center LP.

Assessment and Plan:     1. Multiple myeloma,  remission status unspecified (HCC)    2. History of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy    3. Abnormal positron emission tomography (PET) scan    4. Thrombocytopenia (HCC)          ERNEST HYNEMAN is a 4 y.o. male with multiple myeloma with relapsed/refractory disease through many therapies and auto stem cell transplant.  He underwent CAR-T cell therapy 3/2024.  Most recent PET scan 6/2024 showed ongoing response but not negative yet.  His long-term follow-up plans include:    - no role for maintenance therapy  - would monitor MM with SPEP and free light chains every 3 months   - recommend repeat PET/CT in 6 months  - follow-up brain MRI to evaluate dural thickening  - continue dapsone for PJP prophylaxis until D+180  - continue valacyclovir (changed to acyclovir for payer reasons) for viral prophylaxis  - consider annual bone marrow biopsy including MRD assessment with Clonoseq  - consider IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia associated with CAR T-cell therapy (I.e. if IgG <400 mg/dL), as noted now     We addressed the following issues today:    -Neutropenia due to CAR-T infusion and underlying MM.  Last dose of pegfilgrastim 7/16/2024, ANC today is 1600.  We will continue to monitor with CBCs every 2 weeks until he sees Dr. Dreama Saa again.    -Elevated ferritin.  Ferritin and iron studies are pending.    -ID.  His valacyclovir was changed to acyclovir due to payer issues.  He is taking his dapsone as prescribed, no infectious symptoms or recent infections.    -Abnormal PET scan.  Colonoscopy has been ordered but he has not been contacted, we will reach out to GI to troubleshoot.    -Dural thickening seen on MRI.  Dr. Celine Mans listed follow-up brain MRI for this in her last note, this was seen to be stable between April and June 2024.  Consider updating brain MRI at follow-up.
