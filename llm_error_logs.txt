Older studies demonstrated both a benefit in overall survival of 1-1.5 years and an improvement in progression free survival (18-24 months). The most recent trial the IFM209 (Attal, N Engl J Med 2017;376:1311-20) reported that median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group that underwent  transplantation than in the group that received RVD alone (50 months vs. 36 months)."

He could also use some after shocks headphones in the interim.    If he is otherwise doing well I recommended follow-up in 4 to 6 months to verify that his ears remain free of infection.

This approach has been demonstrated in multiple studies in the literature to produce the best progression-free survival and overall survival for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Older studies demonstrated both a benefit in overall survival of 1-1.5 years and an improvement in progression free survival (18-24 months). The most recent trial the IFM209 (Attal, N Engl J Med 2017;376:1311-20) reported that median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group that underwent  transplantation than in the group that received RVD alone (50 months vs. 36 months)."

He does have a significant conductive hearing loss in both ears.  Because of his chronic perforations he would be a poor candidate for conventional air conduction hearing aids, but would be a good candidate for a bone-anchored hearing device.  He could also use some after shocks headphones in the interim.    If he is otherwise doing well I recommended follow-up in 4 to 6 months to verify that his ears remain free of infection.  We could also discuss possible interventions to assist with his hearing loss."

Repeat bone marrow biopsy 10/18/2019 with 5% residual myeloma plasma cells. Evaluated for auto-transplant at Saint Francis Hospital but did not proceed due to lack of insurance coverage.

Older studies demonstrated both a benefit in overall survival of 1-1.5 years and an improvement in progression free survival (18-24 months). The most recent trial the IFM209 (Attal, N Engl J Med 2017;376:1311-20) reported that median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group that underwent  transplantation than in the group that received RVD alone (50 months vs. 36 months)."

Prior transfusion history:   Per report, the most recent dose of  Isatuximab  monoclonal antibody therapy occurred on 01/03/2024.    CURRENT TRANSFUSION WORKUP   A sample was received at the Shriners' Hospital For Children-Greenville transfusion services lab Va Eastern Kansas Healthcare System - Leavenworth) which demonstrated a blood type of A positive, with a broadly reactive positive antibody screen, and a pan-reactive antibody identification panel. After removing the anti-CD38 interference with dithiothreitol (DTT), no antibodies were identified."

Other blood groups that are less common causes of hemolytic reactions are Kell, Lutheran, YT, JMH, LW, Cromer, Panama, Naranjito, and Knops systems can also be denatured or modified by DTT treatment.     RECOMMENDATIONS    -For routine red blood cell transfusion needs this patient will receive  ABO compatible K antigen negative red blood cells. Please note the serologic crossmatch performed for units for this patient might appear incompatible due to the presence of the monoclonal antibody therapy.  -The additional work-up prior requires an additional hour for the testing/preparation of units.
